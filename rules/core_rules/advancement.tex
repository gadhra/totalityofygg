  Advancing your adventurer (also known as "leveling") allows you to become more powerful.  To gain levels, you need Experiences (XP).  When you get a certain amount of XP, you go up a level.

There are 3 main ways to gain XP: Adventuring, Looting, and Carousing


\mysection{Adventuring}{advancement-adventuring}

Think about the Savage Sword of Conan.  He's out there killing pteranodons and slaying an average of 3 men with one blow, but those feats of strength are all encounters in a chapter of his greater adventures.  They fit nicely in a handful of comic books ("part 3 of 3 - Escape from the Necromancer's Lair)".  The Arbiter is there to help you narrate the chapters of \mybold{your} Adventure, just like R.E.H. did for Conan.

At the end of an Adventure, when you return to Civilization to eat and drink your fill, the Arbiter can award you XP.  It's completely up to her how much this is!  A good rule of thumb is if the Adventure would close a comic series or end a TV arc or finish a section of a novel, that's a good time to assign some XP (Thundarr breaks the werewolf curse; Conan escapes the Demons of the Summit; Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser return to Lankhmar with Ohmphal's fingertips, etc.)



\mysection{Looting and Spending}{advancement-looting-spending}

\flavor{
  There comes a time, thief, when the jewels cease to sparkle, when the gold loses its luster, when the Authority room becomes a prison, and all that is left is a father's love for his child. \Tilde{King Osric}
}

Treasure you loot on your adventures must be spent in order to convert it to XP.  Money you acquire and spend outside of an Adventure doesn't count (so if you pickpocket some rube or setup an opium trade or steal from the king it doesn't count, unless the chapter of your Adventure is entitled "Steal Shit from the King").  This is up to the Arbiter's discretion.

Levels 1 and 2 are the \mybold{Iron levels}.  You get 1xp for every iron piece you loot AND spend in Civilization.  These don't have to be Iron pieces per se -  if you were to loot and spend a single \AU, you would gain 100xp (but you would need to be in a larger civilization to spend it!)

Levels 3-5 are the \mybold{Silver levels}.  You get 1xp for every silver piece you loot AND spend in Civilization 

Levels 6+ are the gold levels.  You get 1xp for for every gold piece you loot AND spend in Civilization


Any coins you spend in Civilization are converted to XP on a 1-to-1 basis, including:

\mybullet {
  \item The amount of money you have to spend to take a Vacation (100\FE; 50\AG; or 25\AU)
  \item Any gear, narcotics, mounts, etc. you buy while in Civilization
  \item Any money you spend on Occultism, Chymistry, Miracles, Medicinals, Staff Magic, Sword Magic, or Inscription
  \item Any money you spend on a Carousing
}

Keep in mind the size of the Civilization you're in - you can't spend gold in Small hamlets!

You'll note that it gets harder and harder to get XP with money as you go up in level.  This is by design - legendary heroes aren't getting experience taking money from orc babies, but by doing epic shit i.e. writing chapters in their Adventure.  In time, the jewels cease to sparkle...


\end{multicols}   



\mysection{Carousing}{advancement-carousing}

If you've spent all the money you can, Carousing is a way to convert any extra coins you've got lying around into XP on a 1-for-1 basis. Say how much money you're going to burn and roll a d20 on the chart below.  You get a +1 for every 100 coins you spend (rounded down)

    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics{Carousing}
    \end{center}


If you decide to go Carousing with a Pooka, you roll a d24 instead.  If a Pooka goes Carousing with you, \myital{they} get 10\% of any XP you make (this is in addition to your XP, they don't take from your XP).  They also have to roll a 20 on the table below, though.



\mytable{l X}{
  \thead{} & \thead{While Carousing you ...} \\
}{
  1  & Accidentally set the town aflame. Roll d6 twice. 1-2 burn down where you're staying; 3-4 some other house burns down; 5-6 a big chunk of town goes up in smoke. 1-2 no one knows it was you; 3-4 your fellow carousers know you did it; 5 someone else knows, perhaps a blackmailer; 6 everybody knows. \\
  2  &  Were robbed whilst unawares. Was it that saucy wench that you swear came to your room? You lose everything of value that you are carrying (Arbiter's discretion) \\
  3 & Talk shit and get called out. You get the XP for this Carousing, but you can't get any more until you do something really awesome designated by the Arbiter, like killing a legendary monster or stealing a legendary treasure. \\
  4 & Get in a fight, lose d3 teeth, get a black eye, or break your nose and you'll be sore (-d3 Grit, min 0) at the start of the next dungeon or fight. \\
  5 & Get alcohol poisoning. Roll a Save vs. Toxins. If you succeed, take 1 damage to Grit.  If you fail, take d6 damage to Grit \\
  6 & Are inducted into a cult. It takes your friends the rest of the Vacation to deprogram you.  Carousing earned you  -10\% XP \\
  7 &   Break some knuckles punching a dude. No two-handed weapons/shields until you Vacation again \\
  8 & Hangover from Hell. Roll twice on the Hang Over effect and take \mybold{both}  effects \\
  9 & Are mistaken for someone else, and charged with their tab. Pay 30\% more money (no xp for it) or wake up in the slammer. \\
  10  & Wake up in stocks. Authorities let you out after a day. \\
  11 & Gain reputation as a lecherous lush. Social interactions in this town are \myital{awkward.}  \\
 12 & Adapt to all the partying. You get +2 to your Save vs Toxins until the next Vacation \\
 13 &Gain 3 rumors about the next adventure  \\
  14  &Totally see through the Snail Knight's disguise, but are cool about it, and he will show up when you need him most. \\
  15 & Dice are hot. Get d100 coins  \\
  16 &Have an epic night and end up with a sweet scar.  \MAX Presence goes up \DCUP  \\
  17  & Win a bar bet and gain the services of two henchmen with low morale for a month. They may stay on if you pay them  \\
  18 & Run into a long-lost relative. Maybe they want to go adventuring with you?! (henchman - high morale)  \\
  19 &  Are mistaken for an important figure and the party gets really going. +25\% XP.  \\
  20+ & Have a lot of fun and get plenty of relaxation \\  
}

\example {
    Mad Tom, Aelfirth, and Stump Beefknob (a Pooka) are all level 1, returning from the Boudoir of Unutterable Horrors laden with loot.  They make their way to Arkham (a Small city, perfect for spending Iron) and elect to take a Vacation.  The Arbiter awards them all 500 xp right off the bat for surviving and killing the Thing Beneath the Bed (completing a Chapter in the Arbiter's story).  They each spend the 100\FE required to take a Vacation, and spend an additional 100\FE each on equipment (plus a trip to the Sanitarium for Mad Tom). They each have 400\FE left.  They all decide to go Carousing together and spend their remaining iron pieces.  

    Because they're Carousing with a Pooka, Mad Tom and Aelfirth both roll a d24 - Stump rolls a d20.  Tom rolls a 14 (10 + 4 for the 400\FE) and sees through the Snail Knight's disguise; now he has an ally that he notes on his character sheet.  Aelfirth rolls a 7 (3+4, bad luck!) and gets alcohol poisoning.  Stump rolls a 15 - looks like he won 43\FE gambling.  

    Tom and Aelfirth get 1,100 xp (500 from the Arbiter, 100 from the Vacation, 100 from equipment, and 400 from going Carousing).  Stump earns 1,180xp (500 from the Arbiter, 100 from the Vacation, 100 from the equipment, 400 from Carousing, plus an extra 10\% of the 800 Tom and Aelfirth collectively earned from their Carousing).

      \item Once per Session, you can declare something to be true because you read it in a book. The base chance of the thing actually being true is 3 in 6. There has to be a plausible way you could know about it from reading books (new discoveries, minor details, and personal secrets are unlikely). You don't know whether or not it is true right away; the Arbiter will roll when it matters. You might only be partially correct, but you will never be catastrophically wrong. If you declare that bugbears fear albino goats, they will either fear albino goats or be indifferent to albino goats. They won't be driven into a murderous rage by them. If you have access to a library of 50 books, the base chance increases to 5 in 6

      \item If your Knowledge Die is a d12, you can increase it \DCUP (d16) \mybold{[Unique]}
    
      \item \mybold{Wisdom:} You have a reputation for wisdom.  If there's a weird problem, people will go to you first. If there's a mutiny and you aren't part of the cause, you will be spared.

    \item \mybold{Tongues of Fire:} You can initiate the willing into your faith by giving them 1 of your Faith die.  The Faith die must be placed inside of a Holy Symbol and given to the initiate. Free assent is required, but it can be compelled by other factors (like a dagger to the throat or other threats).  If the initiate is "willing", gain 2 Faith (the willingness of the initiate is at the discretion of the Arbiter). 
    
    \item \mybold{Limited Immunity:} Choose one source of damage from the following list: 1. iron stabbing weapons; 2. iron chopping weapons; 3. wooden bashing weapons; 4. non-magical fire; 5. drowning. You are completely immune to it. 
}
  

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{ManHat}
\end{center}



\mybullet {
    \item \mybold{Feyness:} you can detect magic, supernatural effects, and general weirdness. 30m range for minor enchantments, charms, and sorceries; 1km range for seriously worrying magical trouble. It might be a premonition, a vision, a cold shudder, a glowing aura, or just a sense that something is "wrong". You can see ghosts and spirits, and they will know and respect you (you never need to roll Sanity for seeing shades or horrors). You know if an item is magical by inspecting it for Minutes. 

    \item \mybold{Safe House:} Depending on the size of a Civilization you're in, you have a chance (Small: 25\%, Medium 75\%, Large 100\%) of finding other practioners of your faith - a coven, cult, church, or what-have-you.  Your brethren will give you information, food, and lodging for free - the amount of money you must pay to take a \mylink{Vacation}{civilization-vacation} reduced by half, but you still get the full XP as if you had spent the coin.  The Arbiter must share a rumor with you about your current or next adventuere - the clue might be obscure, but it must be true

    \item \mybold{Master of Puppets:}  Add +4 to your Necromancy rolls
  }


  \myhighlight{Spriggan}{advancement-leveling-silver-spriggan}

  \mybullet {
    \item Once per Session, you can touch as many iron weapons you wish and make them magical for 1 Minute.  Each weapon you touch will deal 1 Flesh damage to you.  The weapon will stay enchanted for Hours.  The weapon has no additional characteristics, but can hit Monsters only affected by Magic.

    \item \mybold{Dreams of Elfland:}  Once per Session, you can cause every living thing Close to you to fall into a magical slumber.  This works in all ways like the Wizardry spell Sleep. The victims get a Save vs. Hexes and the sleep lasts for d12 Markovian.  The Dreams of Elfland cannot differentiate between Allies and Monsters. 

    \item  \mybold{Anamnesis of the Elements:} you can use your Remembrance to summon and control Elemental creatures for Minutes. 

    \item  \mybold{Anamnesis of the Damned:} you can use your Remembrance to summon and control Demonic creatures for Moments.

    \item Once per Session, you can step into a shadow and become \mylink{Invisible}{effect-invisible}.  You can use this to get the Drop on someone, but there must be a shadow present (you couldn't do this in the middle of a sunny field, for example). 

    \item Once per Session, you can speak to stones and have them reshape themselves.  The stones can't be bigger than 1m in any dimension.  The stone will reshape itself into anything you desire - a large rock could be shaped into a idol, a passage could be made through a wall (provided the wall was less than 1m thick).  The object created is rough hewn - fine detail isn't possible (Arbiter's discretion) 

    \item You can reach into a shadow and pull out a dagger. The dagger exists for as long as it is not exposed to sunlight.  The dagger is magical, and can have Toxins applied to it.  If the dagger takes a life it immediately dissapates.

    \item \mybold{Wound Transference:}  You can transfer your Flesh to Allies on a 1-to-1 basis i.e. for every point of Flesh you transfer, you take 1 point of Flesh damage. You do not need to be touching the Ally, but you do need to be Close to them.  The wounds that appear on your body match the wounds taken by the Ally.  The point of Flesh transferred is enough to keep an Ally from Dying.

    \item \mybold{Fast Metabolism:} You are immune to Toxins, Curses, and Diseases of all sorts

They have 6 Flesh and wear Light armor.  In Combat, these soldiers can each (a) grant you +1 to your Fight or Guard \RO; (b) grant +2 to damage; or (c) take any physical damage for you.  You have to specify what each man-at-arms is doing at the top of each Moment i.e. "2 are giving me +1 to Fight, 1 is giving me +2 damage, and I'm keeping one back to take damage in case things go south.  If a man-at-arms dies or leaves your service, they will be replaced with another when you take a \mylink{Vacation}{civilization-vacation}

    \item \mybold{Battle Rage:} Once per Session, if you are \mylink{Enraged}{effect-enraged}, you can use a Combat Action to kill every Monster in Close range provided they have 2 \HD or less.

    \item \mybold{Surprise, Motherfucker!}  Markovian effects are immedialy reduced by \DCDOWN x2 for you (meaning a d8 Markovian effect will only be a d4, and a d4 will have no effect).

    \item \mybold{Surprise, Motherfucker!} Once per Adventure, at any time, you may declare that you are walking off-screen. During any Session of the Adventure, you may reveal yourself to have been a minor NPC in the background of the scene "all along" as long as there actually are minor NPCs in the background of the scene. You can always walk back on stage at any time, even climbing in a window. This ability is limited by plausibility.

    \item  \mybold{The Plan:} Once per Session, you can declare that you’ve been planning for this very situation all along. Everyone in the group gets +8 to any \RO attempts for Minutes.  You need to tell the Arbiter how you influenced prior actions to lead to this outcome.

    \item  \mybold{The Guild} You become the focal point of a new Thieves Guild.  3 \mylink{Henchmen}{gear-henchmen} with Orderly morale join your cause; they expect nominal pay, room, and board - otherwise, they will need to make periodic Morale checks at the discretion of the Arbiter.

  \mybullet {
    \item If you know the Liturgy of the Apostles of an Authority or Small God, you can learn that Authority or Small God's  Liturgy of the Saints

    \item \mybold{Fishers of Men:} Requires the Virtue \mylink{Crux of Faith}{mystic-virtue-faith}.  2 disciples of the Small God flock to your cause.  These disciples are \mylink{Henchmen}{gear-henchmen} who can provide 1 d4 Faith \POOL (like a Holy Symbol) and have Fanatic morale. If the disciples are Close to you, you may use their Faith as if it were your own; however, if a disciple's Faith is ever exhausted, they will leave your service in Days if it is not restored.  You can give a disciple one of your Faith \POOL at any time (subtracting it from your own), but they can never have more than 1 Faith.  During a \mylink{Vacation}{civilization-vacation}, you can ask your disciples to make a "Test of Faith", each rolling their Faith die.  If they roll a 4, another disciple joins your cause; if they Fail (roll a 1 or a 2), they lose their Faith Die.  You can immediately restore this Faith if you choose, but the disciples can only make 1 roll per Vacation.  You can never have more than 12 disciples.  

    \item \mybold{Charmed Circle:}  Requires the Virtue \mylink{Cunning}{mystic-virtue-cunning}.  A coven of 2 witches join their powers with yours.  These witches are \mylink{Henchmen}{gear-henchmen} who provide 1 Cunning and have Fanatic morale; additionally, they each grant you +1 on your Mojo rolls, provided they are Close to you. You can use their Cunning to practice Occultism during a \mylink{Vacation}{civilization-vacation}, but they must be "in sync" with you; synchronizing your Cunning with them takes a full Widdershins. 

During a \mylink{Vacation}{civilization-vacation} you can choose to "draw down the moon".  Each witch rolls their Cunning Die.  If they roll a 4, another witch joins the Coven; if they Fail (roll a 1 or a 2), the ritual consumes their magic - they don't die, but they can no longer provide any Cunning and will leave the coven at the first opportunity.  You can never have more than 12 other members in your coven.  

    \item  \mybold{Norn's Shears:}  You intercede on behalf of an Ally with Fate itself.  You can stop someone Close or Nearby from dying when there's no hope of survival, provided you can plausibly explain to the Arbiter how they survived ("she must have slipped and fallen out of the way of the dragon's breath at the last second" or "even though we saw him tumble down the Edge of the World, he must have grabbed onto a crevice").  You can only do this once, ever

  \myhighlight{Spriggan}{advancement-leveling-gold-spriggan}

  \mybullet {
    \item Choose one of the Forgotten whose True Name you know.  They are now bound to you permanently, as if they were a henchman or hireling. They will never be unsummoned or summoned by another, cost no Remembrance dice to keep or control, and are unswervingly loyal and treat you as a Small God.  When you reach level 9, you can choose to sacrifice them - through this haruspexy, you can divine the paths that will lead you back to Elfland (but will retire your character).

    \item You can learn the Virtue of Scrying, as detailed below.  Use your Awareness \UD to perform the Scrying.
  }

  \MYSTERY [
  Name= Scry,
  Link=spriggan-virtue-scry,
  Paradigm= Prophesy ,
  Save=  N ,
  Duration= Concentration ,
  Counter=  n/a  ,
  Keywords= None ,
  Target=   Something up to \SUM km away
]



This spell requires something to scry through - a mirror, a quiet pool, clouds, a bonfire, etc.  You create an invisible eye, ear, and mouth that can travel up to \SUM km away at a speed of 10km/hour.

\mylist {
  \item  For as long as you maintain concentration, everything the eye sees is reflected in the thing you're scrying through.  Other people can see what the eye sees if they're looking into the mirror, pool, clouds, bonfire, etc.  as well. The eye, being invisible, can see and be seen by invisible things.  

  \item The ear can hear for you as well.  You can use your Skill: Listen through the ear if you wish.

  \item You can speak through the mouth, including summoning the Forgotten to the location.

}

You can't separate the eye, ear, and mouth - they have to remain together.  The eye, ear, and mouth can fit through a space that you could reasonably pass the real thing through (a mouse hole, but not under a door)

  \myhighlight{Murks}{advancement-leveling-gold-murks}

    \item Once per Session, you can travel through stone or earth up 10km away.

  \myhighlight{Pooka}{advancement-leveling-gold-pooka}

  \mybullet {
    \item \mybold{Martyrdom:}  If an Ally dies, you can take their place.  The Ally needs to be Close or Nearby to you, and they cannot have been dead for longer than Hours.  The body of the Ally must be in reasonably good shape - you can't save them if they've been reduced to ashes, for example.  You do not travel to the Isle of the Dead (being Unhallowed), but those who have been saved by Pooka are said to take on some of their "personality".
    
    \item Advance \mylink{Whispers of Br'er Rabbit}{knave-whisper-brer-rabbit} from Footpad to Sharper (d8) (requires Whispers of Br'er Rabbit: Footpad).

  }


  \example {
The Band of the Big Toe - Mad Tom (a Sellsword), Aelfirth (a Mystic), and Stump (a Pooka) - are all level 1, returning from their first adventure laden with loot. They make their way back to Lankhmar and elect to take a little Vacation. The Arbiter awards them all 500 xp right off the bat for surviving and killing the Thing Beneath the Stair (completing a Chapter in the Arbiter’s story). They each spend 100fe on their Vacation and an additional 100fe on equipment.  After selling a carpet and armoire they managed to secure, they each have 400fe left. They all decide to go Carousing together and spend their remaining iron pieces.

Because they’re Carousing with a Pooka, Mad Tom and Aelfirth both roll a d24 - Stump rolls a d20. Tom rolls a 14 (10 + 4 for the 400fe) and sees through the Snail Knight’s disguise; now he has an ally that he notes on his character sheet. Aelfirth rolls a 7 (3+4, bad luck!) and gets alcohol poisoning. Stump rolls a 15 - looks like he won 43fe gambling. Tom and Aelfirth get 1,100 xp (500 from the Arbiter, 100 from the Vacation, 100 from equipment, and 400 from going Carousing). Stump earns 1,180xp (500 from the Arbiter, 100 from the Vacation, 100 from the equipment, 400 from Carousing, plus an extra 10\% of the 800 Tom and Aelfirth collectively earned from their Carousing).

---

Time passes, and the Band gains more reknown.  Mad Tom reaches level 3; he has a Grit of 11.  He rolls his \FLESH (a d10) twice and takes the highest. He gets a 4 and a 7, so he now has 18 (11+7) Grit.  Tom now picks 3 new Virtues:  he opts to play it safe, moving his \VIG and Presence \DCUP; his Toxins and Hexes Saves \DCUP; and gaining a \DCUP on his Deed Die.  He may have instead wanted to take the Blademaster Virtue, or upgraded his Armor - but any way he breaks it down, he can only pick 3 new Virtues from the appropriate tables
