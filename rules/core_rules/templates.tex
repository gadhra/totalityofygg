  Sellswords add their \LVL to any \RO or \RB attempt they're trying that that includes their \VIG.  Sellswords also add their \LVL to weapon damage.  This bonus is applied \mybold{after}  the die explodes.

  \mysubsection{Exploding Damage}{sellsword-damage}

  If a Sellsword hits for \MAX damage on the die, the die explodes i.e. they roll again and add the second roll to the first.  If they roll \MAX damage again, the roll continues.  This roll must be the \myital{natural} (not modified) maximum roll on the die (though some powers and abilities can change a natural roll).  Modifiers to damage are added or subtracted to the damage \mybold{after}  the die explodes (including Deed Die).  Note this means that Sellswords don't Crit as other classes do.

  \example{Charse, a level 1 Sellsword, attacks a goblin with a Shortsword (d6).  He makes his Fight check and hits, and rolls a 6 for damage. He rolls again and rolls another 6.  He rolls a 3rd time and rolls a 4.  He deals 17 points of damage(!) [6+6+4+\LVL] and the goblin is reduced to a fine pink mist.}

 

  \mysubsection{Deed Dice}{sellsword-deed-dice} 

  Sellswords have a Deed Die - a unique \UD whose result can be applied to any of their Fight checks. Roll the Deed Die and add its result to your Fight check.  If the Fight check hits, the result of the Deed Die is \mybold{also}  added to the damage for the attack. If you wish, you can roll your Deed Die  \myital{after} your initial Fight check is rolled.  You get your Deed Die back by taking a Sojourn or longer rest.  The damage for a Deed Die is applied \mybold{after}  the die explodes, if applicable.  You can only roll your Deed Die once per Moment.

  \flavor{
    We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
    For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
    Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
    This day shall gentle his condition;
    And gentlemen in England now a-bed
    Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here,
    And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
    That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.

  War is life. It is the natural state of humankind; we are born screaming and die fighting and everything else is details.  There is an artistry to war, a rhythm to it - and like every rhythm, it calls on you to dance.  You will not know yourself until you have placed your life on the line - for money, for fame, for glory, for triumph. You will never know the true taste of food or cold water until you make war shoulder to shoulder with your brothers and sisters.  "Blood is thicker than water," they say - but the meaning has become lost to time.  You remember, though.  Those who shed blood together know a transcendent bond.  Your purpose is war, and nothing else is relevant.

  \mysubsection{Level Bonus}{soldier-bonus}

  \mybullet {

    \item \mybold{Level 5:}  If you have a banner in one of your hands, you can perform a Rallying Cry.  Make an \RS : Presence. If you don't roll a failure, for every Moment for the remainder of Combat you can forego a Fight check to allow all Allies to win Init.
    \item\mybold{Level 7:}  You attract a band of warriors around you. 7 men-at-arms pledge their blades to your cause. They have Orderly morale; are armed with Light armor, shields, helmets, and spears - they are otherwise Level 0 characters.

  \mysection{Flavor: Barbarian}{flavor-barbarian}

  \flavor{Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of the Earth under his sandaled feet. \Tilde R.E.H.}

  No Gods.  No masters.  No wizardry.  No tricks.  No illusions.  Only freedom.  This is the great gift of the Authority, but so many are afraid of what true sovereignty means that they make laws to protect them and bestow power to others over them and give up the open road to live in a cage.  Civilization is a slave's collar.  Friends are traitors.  You need only steel at your side to make your way in the world, nothing more.  There is no calvalry to save you, no Gods to protect you.  There is only you.  We all die alone.  Grapple with that fear, master it, rush headlong into the Void screaming a battle song, eat and drink your fill when you can.  We all die alone.  But you will live and die free.

    \example{
    Savage. Ranger. Scout. Warden. Warrior. Conan, Thundarr, Fafrd, Robin Hood, Strider, Ragnar Lodbrook, Ned Kelly, Zatoichi, and One Eye (Valhalla Rising). \href{https://www.pinterest.com/gadhra/the-totality-of-ygg-beta-rules/Barbarian/}{Visual reference}
