\mysubsection{Monster Morale}{monster-morale}

Morale is broken into 3 general types:  Cowardly, Orderly, and Fanatical.  Roll Morale by rolling 2d6 - if the number is greater than the basic roll (but not equal to!), they will attempt to flee or surrender.

\mybullet {
  \item \mybold{Cowardly} Basic roll is 3.  If the Monsters are in a group, roll a) when the first Monster dies (but only if the Monsters are outnumbered; b) when half the Monsters are down; or c) whenever a "leader" dies.  If the Monster is by itself, roll a) when it first takes damage and b) when it's at half Health or less.

  \item \mybold{Orderly} Basic roll is 7.  If the Monsters are in a group, roll a) when half the Monsters are down; or b) if \mybold{all}  the leaders are dead.  If the Monster is by itself, roll when it's at half Health or less.

  \item \mybold{Fanatical}  Basic roll is 11.  If the Monsters are in a group, roll when half the Monsters are down AND all the leaders are dead.  If the Monster is by itself, it will automatically pass a morale check.

\mysubsection{Monster Soak}{monster-soak}

Soak is a general term to represent a damage threshold because of armor, thick scales or carapaces, or tough or rubbery bodies.  The amount of damage from a \mybold{physical attack}  is reduced by the amount of the Soak.  For example, a Monster with a Soak of 3 would ignore 3 points of damage from a physical attack (so if you roll a 4 for damage, the Monster will only take 1 point of damage).  Certain Monsters have a Soak against specific types of weapons (for example, Skeletons can Soak 1 point of Stabbing damage).  Murder bypasses Soak, and Rend reduces Soak by 1.

The Sons of Kyuss are extraordinarily racist and xenophobic aberrations bent on the genocide of every last person in the Universe that is not a Son of Kyuss.  The Sons appear as floating orbs with 6 eyestalks and a gigantic maw.

In addition to biting anyone Close to them, the eyes of the Son of Kyuss act independently of the body.  They can be cut off with a successful Gambit - should that happen, roll a d6 and remove that eye.

The eyes are utterly chaotic and insane, so they only work sometimes.  At the start of each Moment, roll a d6 - this is the ber of eyes that will be able to attack this Moment in addition to the bite attack.

  \item Roll the dragon's age: 1) Juvenile, 2) Adult, 3) Old, 4) Very Old, 5) Ancient, 6) Wyrm

    \item  \mybold{Terrifying Presence:}   Creatures with fewer than half the dragon's \HD (rounded down) must Save vs. Doom or become Afraid.  Seeing this creature the first time prompts a Sanity roll.
    \item \mybold{Roar:}  Instead of \myital{all} of it's base Close attacks, the dragon can let out a horrifying roar.  Every enemy Nearby must make a Sanity roll and a Save vs. Doom.  Failing the Save means you are Deafened for d4 Markovian.

Take the [sum] of the dragon's age and size rolls.  This is the base damage for their breath weapon as well as how many times they can use it in Combat:

There are 2 ways to reduce the damage from a breath weapon:
\mynumlist {
  \item Roll your Talent \UD If you succeed (don't roll a 1 or 2), take half damage.
  \item Make a Save vs. Doom. If you succeed, take half damage again.
}

\cbreak

These effects stack - so making your Talent roll + Save vs. Doom will reduce the amount of damage by 75\%. Roll the check and Save before you apply damage to Armor or Flesh. 

Finally, the color of the dragon also affects the breath weapon:
\mylist {
  \item \mybold{Red:}   Fire.  Roll a Talent check, or catch fire \item d4 damage at the top of each Moment until you spend an entire Moment doing "stop, drop, and roll".  This can be shortened to a single Maneuver if someone helps you.
  \item \mybold{Black:}  Acid.  If the attack hits Flesh, take 2d4 acid damage for 2d4 Moments (see Bell, Book, and Candle)
  \item \mybold{White:}  Frost.  Roll an additional Save vs. Doom or take \DCDOWN to a Tangible Stat (your choice)
  \item \mybold{Blue:}  Lightning.  If you're wearing metal armor, take an additional 2 points of damage per die.
  \item \mybold{Green:}  Corrosive gas.  Everyone roll their Armor \UD
  \item \mybold{Bone:}  Void.  Roll an additional Save vs. Doom or take \DCDOWN damage to an Intangible Stat (your choice)
  You can sunder your shield to prevent the secondary effect (but not the damage).
