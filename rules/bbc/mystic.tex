\mysection{Faith and Grace}{faith-and-grace}

\flavor{ 
  And it has been said of old that all things that have been were wrought by the small gods, excepting only \TheAuthority, the Authority, the God of Having Done, who made the gods, and hath thereafter rested.  And none may pray to \TheAuthority but only to the gods whom he hath made.
}

  \mytable{X c}{
    \thead{Level} & \thead{Grace/\MAX Faith} \\
  }{
    1 & 1d4 \POOL / 8 \\
    2-3 & 2d4 \POOL / 10  \\
    4-5 & 3d4 \POOL / 12 \\
    6-7 & 4d4 \POOL / 16 \\
    8 & 5d4 \POOL / 20  \\
    9 & 6d4 \POOL / 24 \\
  }

Grace belongs to the Authority, and is represented by a single \UD.  Since it is forbidden to pray to the Authority directly, it falls to the Small Gods to help Mortals instead.  Faith in these \mylink{Small Gods}{mystics-small-gods} allows Mystics to practice \mylink{Liturgies and Invocations}{mystic-liturgies-invocations}.


\mysubsection{Grace}{mystic-grace}

Grace allows you to perform the \mylink{Seven Sacraments}{mystic-seven-sacraments}.  You get a number of Grace die (which are all d4) depending on your level (see the core rules).  

Grace Die are \POOL, meaning if you roll a Failure (a 1 or a 2) you lose the die until you rest.  You can restore 1 Grace \POOL whenever you Bivouac. You can never use Grace to perform something that requires Faith, but you can sometimes use your Faith to affect Grace, depending on the Small God you worship.  You do not need your \mylink{Holy Symbol}{mystic-holy-symbol} to invoke the Seven Sacraments, but you cannot do so on Unhallowed Earth.  

\mysubsection{Faith}{mystic-faith}

Since it is forbidden to worship the Authority directly, you must worship one of the \mylink{Small Gods}{mystics-small-gods}, the Gods of Doing. Each Throne and Power has its own set of \mylink{Liturgies and Invocations}{mystic-liturgies-invocations} independent of the \mylink{Seven Sacraments}{mystic-seven-sacraments}.  Your belief in your Small God is measured using Faith Dice. 

The Throne your Small God sits beneath grants you certain abilities and dictates what weapons and armor you are permitted to use. 

Each Small God has a set of four Invocations that manifest their power on Acheron, and a set of four Liturgies that grant boons for allies and bane for enemies.  You must be wearing the \mylink{Holy Symbol}{mystic-holy-symbol} of your Small God to solicit \mylink{Invocations or perform Liturgies}{mystic-liturgies-invocations}.  You may perform \mylink{Liturgies and Invocations}{mystic-liturgies-invocations}. on Hallowed or Unhallowed Earth.

The Faith Die is a single d4 \POOL.  You start with 2 Faith Die, and gain 2 Faith Die every time you go up in level.  If you roll a 1 or a 2 on a Faith Die, you lose the die.  You cannot use your Faith Die to cast any of the Seven Sacraments unless your Small God explicitly allows it.

Unlike Grace, Faith does not come back when you rest.  You can gain or regain Faith up to your Maximum by:
\mylist {
  \item worshipping at a church or shrine during a Sojourn (+1 Faith) or Sabattical (+2 Faith)
  \item witnessing divine intervention or proof of your Small God (Arbiter's discretion)
  \item actively achieving things in your Small God's name (Arbiter's discretion)
}

Some examples of things that might gain you Faith: slaughtering the priest of a rival cult; converting a crowd of listeners; invoking your God and succeeding; eating hallucinogenic mushrooms and your God copulates with you while proclaiming your destiny, etc.

It's possible to lose Faith through your actions, as well.  When you do something your Small God doesn't approve of or witnesses something which would shake your belief: a commune of the converted found diseased deformed and starved, a call for help which goes unanswered, a nocturnal visit by a creeping hulking thing which whispers terrible secrets of the endless sky into the your ear heedless to the invocation of your God, you lose Faith Die.

If your Faith Die reach 0, you must immediately roll a d4 - on a Failure (a 1 or a 2) you suffer a \mylink{Crisis of Faith}{table-crisis-of-faith}.  If you pass you may continue to use Faith, though you are limited to 1 d4 at a time.  If you ever Fail your roll while out of Faith, you immediately suffer a Crisis of Faith. 

You cannot gain more Faith die then your \MAX Faith for your \LVL.

\mysection{The Seven Sacraments}{mystic-seven-sacraments}

You may only use Grace to perform the Seven Sacraments, unless otherwise allowed by the Small God you worship

  Link=mystic-sacrament-bless,
  Paradigm=Grace,

  Target=Close Ally or object
]



Choose one effect per Faith invested: 
1. The Ally can make a Save at a 6-in-6; 
2. The Ally's can automatically succeed on a \RO or \RS check;
3. The Ally can immediately end a Markovian duration affecting them;
4. The Ally or object is Hallowed for the remainder of the Session (this negates the detriment Unhallowed)

Once an effect is used, it disappears (though the Blessing can be recast)

  Link=mystic-sacrament-consecrate,
  Paradigm=Grace,
  Save=N,
  Duration=Concentration,
  Counter=n/a,
  Keywords=None,
  Target=Close radius
]

You exude a \DICE x10m radius area of \mylink{Hallowed Ground}{miracle-hallowed-ground} around yourself, with the same benefits.  You can't move while concentrating on this Sacrament.

Note that the area of Consecrated Ground will temporarily cancel out the effects of \mylink{Unhallowed Earth}{occultism-unhallowed-earth} (making it "normal"), but that Sacraments cannot be performed while you are on Unhallowed Ground.

  Duration=0,
  Counter=n/a,

]

Heal up to \SUMDICE points of Flesh by touch. You may distribute healing among as many creatures as you would like, as long as the total Flesh healed does not exceed \SUMDICE and you maintain concentration. If you invest 4 \DICE or more, you may instead heal a single target's Flesh fully

\DICE sticks become snakes.  They owe you no favors and won't heed your commands unless you can speak to snakes.  Each snake has a \DICE-in-6 chance of having an Iron venom.  The stick must be small enough to lift with one hand. 



\LITURGY [

You and up to \DICE-1 Allies can slowly walk over water for as long as you maintain Concentration.

\mysection{Divine Favor}{mystic-divine-favor}

You may call upon your Small God to directly intercede on your behalf.  To do this, you must roll \mybold{all} of your Faith dice, the \SUMDICE of the roll must be 60 or better.

The divine favor must be something in the sphere of your Small God (Arbiter's Discretion).  The Small Gods cannot violate the basic laws of the Authority:

\mybullet {
  \item Matter and energy can neither be created nor destroyed, as this is the demense of the Authority; they can only be transformed or changed from one form to another.  Once a spirit has departed for the Isle of the Dead, it is beyond the reach of the Small Gods forever. 

  \item Entropy always increases.  Time cannot flow backward; sword strikes cannot heal; you cannot "fall" against the direction of gravity. It is possible to suspend this Law (to roll back time, for instance), but only for a few Moments before it reverts to entropy again.

  \item A \myital{noumenon} cannot be removed by a Small God. A Small God cannot directly slay something on the Mortal plane.

  \item All matter and energy has a destiny in the dream of the Authority.  A Small God cannot cause matter or energy to do something that violates this destiny, and the ultimate destiny is only known to the Authority. (Practically, this means the effects of a Divine Favor are up to the Arbiter's discretion in the end!)
}

The Small God may also demand a sacrifice of some kind, or expect payment later ...

\example {
  \mylist {
    \item Time rolls back for a few seconds to stop a killing blow from falling, or to reroll a missed Save.

    \item A powerful magical item or artifact needs to be sundered

    \item A sea must be parted, a tunnel opened through a mountain, or a boulder pushed to seal an entrance

    \item Stones and trees, or sand and ice, assemble themselves into a fortress to protect the faithful
  }
}

\newpage

\mysection{Liturgies and Invocations}{mystic-liturgies-invocations}

Each Small God has a set of four Invocations that manifest their power on Acheron, and a set of four Liturgies that grant boons for allies and bane for enemies.  Only the First Liturgy and Invocation for each Small God are listed below. Additional Liturgies must be discovered - etched on bronze tablets hidden by fearful priests in stinking swamps, forgotten in reliquaries lying in pawn shops, or written by the slime of snails tripping balls on Shrooms.


\mysubsection{The Holy Symbol}{mystic-holy-symbol}

You must be wearing removed, you cannot perform Liturgies or Sacraments (though you may still perform acts of Grace).  

Your Holy Symbol is defined beneath the description of your Small God.  If you lose your holy symbol, or it's destroyed, you must perform the Miracle of \mylink{Holy Relic}{miracle-holy-relic} to create a new one.  Remember that your Holy Symbol contains a single Faith die that you can use in a pinch.  If you use this Faith Die and roll a Failure, the Faith Die is lost and the Holy Symbol becomes a normal item (and can't be used to perform Liturgies or Invocations anymore)

\newpage

\mysection{The Small Gods}{mystics-small-gods}

The Small Gods are broken into 10 Thrones, each containing 7 Small Gods.  Certain heresies say that there are more gods and thrones than even these.

You reach into a mirror-like surface and pull out a copy of yourself.  The mirror has to be big enough for you to walk through - same height and same width, at least.  The copy behaves just like you, but it's illusory - anything that touches it will pass right through it, and it can't pick anything up or hold anything.  You can switch places with your mirror-self by stepping through the mirror - this dispels the illusion.

You can convert up to \SUMDICE kg of coins into coins of another type of equivalent value (as a reminder, there are 100 coins in a kg, and 4kg of coins are 1 Significant Item).
For example, if the \SUMDICE of your dice roll was 10 you could convert 1,000 iron pieces (10kg) into 100 silver pieces (1kg) or 10 gold pieces (1/10kg); or you could convert 10 gold pieces into 100 silver pieces or 1,000 iron pieces.
Additionally, you can place up to \DICE X100kg of coins into "hammerspace" for an indefinite period of time; the coins essentially cease to exist, have no Encumbrance, and cannot be stolen or taken by others (though the existence of the coins can be divined through a Scry spell or similar).  You can retrieve the coins at any time (though you have to retrieve all of them at once).  The coins are also released upon your death, meaning that you might occassionally be a target of thieves.
You can combine the effects above (so you could convert money and store it in hammerspace if you'd like).  You must cast this spell each time you want to put more coins into hammerspace, but everything that's in hammerspace is released upon your death.

\LITURGY [

 Up to \DICE X250kg of nonliving objects, as you designate, are packed neatly. You must name the objects or their general category when you cast the spell ("those coins", "the contents of that room") If no packing materials are provided, the objects will be stacked into compact cubes, with the largest and most stable objects at the bottom. If chests, paper and twine, sacks, carts, etc. are provided, the spell will use them as you direct. The packages created will take up the minimum space possible, and will be remarkably sturdy. The spell will continue to pack objects for as long as you maintain concentration. The objects must be able to move freely. You could not use this spells to pack clothes someone was wearing. The objects will not lift more than 3m off the ground during the packing process.

A clamp of red light appears over \DICE Monsters or objects you designate. The maximum width of the clamp is \DICE meters, and the clamp must be able to fit around the objects (so you wouldn't be able to clamp something to a floor or a wall).  The clamp will push the objects together until they are held securely, but it will not damage either object.  For example, you could clamp an orc to a chair or a sword to a table.  If one of the things clamped is a living thing, the creature can break free if they \RB : \VIG with a -\DICE penalty; otherwise, the duration depends on the number of dice spent:  1 [die]: Minutes; 2 \DICE: Days; 3 \DICE: Weeks; 4 \DICE: Months; 5 \DICE: Years; 6+ \DICE: Permanent.  Save negates.

A magical blacksmith's hammer appears in your hand that only you can wield.  The hammer deals \DICE damage up to a maximum of 8.  You can also repair the Max \UD of an Ally's armor during a Bivouac.  For every \DCUP you repair in this way, the damage of the hammer goes down by 1.  The hammer can strike creatures who are only struck by magical weapons, but because there is no die to roll when dealing damage, it cannot Crit or be Fumbled.

You run your hands over \DICE metal, stone, or wooden edges and hone them to a razor sharpness. If the object is a Bashing weapon, it deals +\DICE damage; if the object is a Stabbing or Chopping weapon, it deals +\DICE X2 damage. The edge must be smaller than your outstretched arms.

Your \MD drops to d4 when you invoke this liturgy.  The \UD for the Armor depends on the number of \DICE invested: 1 d4; 2-3 d6; 4-6 d8; 7-9 d10; 10+ d12.

You must be near a body of water to use this liturgy (a river is OK, a puddle isn't).  You summon a lock up to \DICE meters in length, width, and height.  The box can hold up to \DICE X100kg in weight, or about 25 Significant Items (provided the box is big enough in terms of height, width, and depth i.e. you could put a 2 meter long pole in a 1 [die] locker).  Once you seal the box and carve your name onto it, the waters will take the locker back beneath the surface, where it will disappear.  At any time, you can return to the same body of water and bring the locker back from the depths. Nothing else can bring the locker back from the deeps (not even the liturgy of Dredge) except your death.  When you die, the locker will wash up on shore within a few days for some lucky (or unlucky) soul to find.

Once per Session, you can appear as someone you're not for a few Moments (enough time to walk past a guard, disappear in a crowd, or destroy an alibi).  The illusion would survive a casual glance but not deep inspection

\mybold{First Liturgy}

You may use your Faith to cast the following spells: Illusion (as Sorcerer spell); Mirror Image (as Sorcerer spell); Strange Copy; Tattered Robe

You reach into a mirror-like surface and pull out a copy of an object reflected in the mirror. The object that you pull out must be within reach of the mirror (as if it were a window), small enough to fit through the mirror (as if it were a window) and can't weigh more than \DICE X10kg. The mirror object looks and feels exactly like the object it copied, though it is a mirror image (so if you were to copy a book, the text would be backwards).  You can't copy any magical properties of the object, and you can only duplicate objects, not living things.  The object exists for \SUMDICE Minutes.  If the object suffers a solid blow, it pops like a bubble.

You must be wearing robes without armor to use this liturgy.  The edges of your robes form into \DICE tatters, each of which can be used as a weapon in combat in addition to your regular attack. The tatters deal no damage and each of their attacks must be rolled separately using your \FOC instead of your \VIG or \DEX - but if you hit the target begins Bleeding unless they make a Save.  You can split these attacks among as many Close opponents as you desire.
The tatters can also be used to hold small objects, as if they were each a prehensile tail.  Each tatter can hold up to 50kg of weight, but cannot attack if they are holding something.

You whisper a word on the wind which travels to a Close, Nearby, or Far-Away target of \DICE X2 \HD or less. The target must be able to understand you.  Once the word reaches the ear of the victim, they must Save or become Befuddled.  The duration is Markovian and depends on the number of \DICE invested.

You can create a memory (real or not) and embed it in the head(s) of up to \DICE creatures by touch.  Unwilling creatures may Save to negate the spell.  The memory must be short and distinct.  The memory will start to fade in a few days, but if you win a \RB : \FOC attempt against the victim (the victim has a -\DICE penalty) when you invoke the liturgy, the memory will never fade, even if they lose all other memories (incidentally, this is is a really great way to create a ghost or poltergeist).

You can speak with spiders (and they can speak with you).  Small spiders know about water, wind, and bugs.  Larger spiders know about people (maybe they can tell them apart).  Big, dangerous spiders know all kinds of things.  Spiders will be friendly towards you, but if you attack them they'll fight back.  Additionally, your spittle becomes a Toxin whose power depends on the number of \DICE spent: 1 [die] Iron Toxin; 3 \DICE Silver Toxin; 6 \DICE Gold Toxin.  Your spittle is enough to poison a drink, a needle or syringe, or infect someone you might bite, but not enough to poison a knife or dagger.  The spittle becomes normal when the duration ends.

You can invoke this liturgy to prevent bloodshed among up to \DICE creatures who have not yet begun Combat.  They must be able to speak the same language as you.  The creatures must roll their morale with a -\DICE penalty; if they fail, they will lower any weapons and regard you with wary suspicion.  If used against Allies, the ally must win a \RB : \FOC against you with a -\DICE penalty.  Weaker Monsters will usually follow the lead of stronger Monsters.  Once Combat has begun, the liturgy immediately ends.  If you attack a group of Monsters who are under the effects of Becalm, you will win Surprise.

  Target=   Close or Nearby Monsters
]



You shout this liturgy at up to \DICE Monsters.  To you and to anyone else, the words you've shouted are incomprehensible - but the Monsters interpret it as a magical command that is impossible to fulfill.  "Fall down and jump up at the same time" is a possible translation, but the conflict is more fundamental.  The target(s) take \DICE damage depending on the number of dice targeting them, and must Save or be Knocked Out.  The duration is Markovian and depends on the number of \DICE invested.  The Monster must speak the same language as you.

You shout a one word command at up to \DICE Close or Nearby target, who must obey (Save negates).  The target(s) must be able to understand your language.  The command resonates for a Markovian duration - if the Markovian die is not a 1 or a 2, they must Save again.  Each Moment after the first the target(s) gain an additional +1 to their Save.  The command cannot directly cause the target(s) harm or force them to commit a harmful action.  You could cause them to run into a trap they didn't know was there, or into a tactically disadvantageous position, but not off a cliff.

Once per Session you may ask the Arbiter for a hint to a problem you're facing. It might be which way to go when lost in a dungeon, a push in the right direction for a riddle, or a sense of what some clue might mean (or if it's even a clue at all). It can't be the specific location of something or someone. The resolution of this is \myital{entirely} up to the Arbiter's discretion (including denying the request, though the Invocation is not lost in this case)

Name a Skill - it can be one of the 7 basic skills, or any other skill you choose (though you can't learn things that would not be contained in a well stocked library, or that are so rare that only a few people could teach them to you).  Gain a \DICE-in-6 {knack} in that Skill for the spell's duration.  If you already know the Skill, add \DICE to the {knack} instead (so if you have a 3-in-6 and spend 2 Faith, you would have a 5-in-6).

  Save=  N ,
  Duration= Combat or \SUMDICE Minutes ,

You create a spiraling labyrinth of thought in your mind.  Anyone targeting you with Charm, Sleep, or any magical effect whereby the caster tries to read your mind or alter your memories must enter into a \RB : \FOC contest with you at a -\DICE penalty.  If they fail, they will be caught in your mind for the duration of the liturgy.  If you win, the creature is trapped inside your mind - they immediately catch the Vapors, and you can hear all their thoughts.

\LITURGY [
  Name= Reveal Ownership,

  Save=  N ,
  Duration= \SUMDICE Minutes ,
  Counter=  n/a  ,
  Keywords= Splittable ,
  Target=   Close objects
]



Touch up to \DICE objects; letters appear over the objects, spelling out the name of the owner or owners.  The name shown will be the name the owner used when they purchased or acquired the objects (so if they were obtained under an alias, it will just show the alias). 
If you use 2 \DICE, the liturgy will also show if the ownership is disputed (the dead cannot dispute ownership).  If you use 3 \DICE, arrows will appear pointing in the direction of the owner, or a skull will appear if they are deceased.  If you use 4 \DICE, true names will appear alongside the alias as long as the owner is mortal.
The liturgy works on slaves (including those under the effect of Charm Person) and domesticated animals.  If the object has no owner, nothing happens.

\LITURGY [
  Name= Scry,
  Link=thoth-liturgy-scry,
  Paradigm= Prophesy ,
  Save=  N ,
  Duration= Concentration ,
  Counter=  n/a  ,

  Target=   Something up to \DICE km away
]



This spell requires something to scry through - a mirror, a quiet pool, clouds, a bonfire, etc.  You create an invisible eye that can travel up to \DICE km away at a speed of 10km/hour.  Because the eye is invisible, it can see and be seen by invisible things.  For as long as you maintain concentration, everything the eye sees is reflected in the thing you're scrying through.  Other people can see what the eye sees if they're looking into the mirror, pool, clouds, bonfire, etc.  as well. 
If you use 3 or more Faith, the eye is joined by an invisible ear that can hear for you as well; if you use 5 or more Faith, the eye and ear are joined by a mouth you can speak through.  You can't separate the eye, ear, and mouth - they have to remain together.  The eye, ear, and mouth can fit through a space that you could reasonably pass the real thing through (a mouse hole, but not under a door)

You can command the sunburst to change color, move horizontally, or explode.  No shadows can be cast beneath the sunlight (meaning Skulking is impossible), and all invisible creatures and objects appear with a thin halo around them the color of the sun.  Anyone who performs the sacrament Curse the Unhallowed while under the Glorious Sunburst adds an additional +\DICE to their damage, and anyone Close to the sunburst if it explodes takes \SUMDICE+\DICE damage, Save for half.

It has to be something you've seen clearly before.  Once named, the seeker will fly to it at the speed of an arrow and hover near it, chiming as loud as a bell.  If the object is not within the spell's range, it will have a \DICE-in-6 chance of finding a similar object; otherwise, it disappears.

The range you can safely fall is increased by +\LVL x2 meters i.e. at level 1 you could fall an additional 2 meters, at level 9 you could fall an additional 18 meters.  The distance is deducted from the fall - so a fall of 30m at level 9 would be the equivalent to a fall of 12m, and a fall of 23m would deal no damage (23 - 18 = 5m, the maximum distance you can fall without taking damage)

It can be asked to trip targets when they run past, jump off a shelf when a certain person enters a room, etc.  The stone can launch itself into the air at your command and strike a target Close, Nearby, or Far-Away for up to \DICE damage (you can make this damage 0 if you'd like, in order to get someone's attention), and can do this once every Moment for the duration.

Outlines of the planets, major stars, sun, and moon appear around you. You can use them to determine the time of day, true north, and your approximate position on the globe.

You create \DICE small moons that circle the top of your head, casting moonlight Close and Nearby.  The shadows thrown by this moonlight give a +\DICE bonus to Skulking rolls and give everyone in range a +\DICE-in-6 chance to find secret doors and hidden writing (so if you have a 2-in-6 Math skill and spend 2 dice, your chance of finding secret doors will go to 4-in-6). The moonlight will activate abilities and powers that manifest in lunar rays (like lycanthropy).  The moons throw light equivalent to \DICE candles.
You can pluck one or more of these orbs from around your head and throw it at a Monster Nearby using your \FOC to attack; on a successful hit, the moon(s) deal \SUMDICE+\DICE damage, Save for half.  When you have no moons left, the spell ends.

The Lunacy is random for each Monster that fails its Save.  Roll a d4:  1) the Monster becomes Enraged; 2) the Monster becomes Afraid; 3) the Monster is Knocked Out; 4) the Monster suffers Anathema.  The duration is Markovian and depends on the number of \DICE used.

A magical circle \DICE meters in radius extends from your fingertip in front of you. As long as you maintain concentration, you can absorb any wind passing through the circle. You can then collapse the spell.

If you activate this spell in a light breeze for 5 minutes, the spell will release a light breeze over 5 minutes. The wind only flows from the circle, so anyone standing behind it is not affected (unless you release hurricane-force winds indoors). You can cancel the release at any time, which expends the spell as usual. If you enter Death's Door while the spell is still "reserved", it immediately activates facing a random direction.  
If the wind is a magical breath that would do damage (dragon's breath, etc.) your \SUMDICE must be equal to or greater than the sum of the damage, or the circle immediately collapses.

  Save=  Y (half) ,
  Duration= 0 ,
  Counter=  n/a  ,

  Target=   Far-Away Monster
]



Target takes \SUMDICE+\DICE damage, Save for half. You do not need to see the target, but you do need to know their approximate location (within 1m), and there must be a clear path a bolt could trace to reach them. The path can be as convoluted as required. The bolt can pass through gaps as small as a fist.  Note that this spell can only target Far-Away creatures.
\LITURGY [

  Target=   Far-Away Monster
]



Invisible hammers of Force strike up to \DICE Monsters from every direction.  Target Monsters take \DICE Bashing damage each, depending on how you split the die (Save for half).  The liturgy lasts for as long as you Concentrate.  Concentration and spell-casting is impossible while being struck by these hammers. Note that this spell can only target Far-Away creatures.

\LITURGY [

  Save=  Y (negates) ,
  Duration= Markovian ,

  Keywords= None ,
  Target=   Far-Away creature of \DICE+\DICE HD or less
]



The target of this spell must have limbs.  With a snap of the fingers, \DICE of the target's limbs bend, crack, and break.  If an arm is broken, anything held in the hand is immediately dropped; if a leg is broken, the creature falls Prone; if both arms are broken, nothing can be picked up (and no spells can be cast); if both legs are broken, the Monster can only crawl.  The limbs remain broken for the Markovian duration, after which they immediately heal with no ill effects. Save negates.  Note that this spell can only target Far-Away creatures.

\LITURGY [
  Name= Shrikeblast,

You let out a scream which shatters into shards of force.  The shards can lacerate up to \DICE  Far-Away Monsters and deal \SUMDICE+\DICE damage depending on how you split the dice up, Save for half. If a creature is killed by this spell, it will be suspended in the position it was killed for \SUMDICE Minutes by by the shards. A suspended creature is capable of bearing up to its own body weight in additional pressure before falling.  Note that this spell can only target Far-Away creatures.

Link=small-god-xibalba,
GodOf=Fiendish Prince of Fear,

\mybold{First Invocation}

\mybold{First Liturgy}

You may use your Faith to cast the following spells: Scare; Thunderclap; Zone of Sinister Stillness; Wall of Gloom

\LITURGY [
  Name= Scare,
  Link= xibalba-liturgy-scare,
  Paradigm= Mind ,
  Save=  Y (negates) ,
  Duration= Markovian ,
  Counter=  n/a  ,
  Keywords= Splittable ,
  Target=   Close or Nearby Monsters
]



Up to \DICE Close or Nearby Monsters with combined \HD equal to or less than \DICE must Save or become Afraid.  The duration is Markovian and depends on the number of \DICE invested.

\LITURGY [
  Name= Sinister Stillness,
  Link=xibalba-liturgy-sinister stillness,
  Paradigm= Mind ,
  Save=  N ,
  Duration= Combat or \SUMDICE Minutes ,
  Counter=  n/a  ,
  Keywords= None ,
  Target=Any Area
]



You can invoke this liturgy in an area  Close, Nearby, Far-Away, or Distant from yourself.  The air Close to the area takes on an unsettling air of silence.  Sound is not magically suppressed, but Monsters and creatures within its bounds feel that any sound they make will disturb something better left undisturbed.  Non-intelligent animals will not enter the area, and Monsters inside must make an immediate morale check. Thereafter, Saves against fear effects have a -\DICE penalty (minimum 1), and morale rolls suffer a -\DICE penalty.  A morale check is needed to enter or pass through the area of the spell.

\LITURGY [
  Name= Thunderclap,
  Link=xibalba-liturgy-thunderclap,
  Paradigm= Elements ,
  Save=  Y (negates Deafness) ,
  Duration= 0 ,
  Counter=  n/a  ,
  Keywords= None ,
  Target=   Far-Away or Distant area
]



Invoke this liturgy somewhere Far-Away or Distant from yourself.  Monsters Close to the Thunderclap must immediately make a morale check with a -\DICE penalty, or become Afraid.  Additionally, Monsters become Deafened for \DICE Moments unless they make a Save

\LITURGY [
  Name= Wall of Gloom,
  Link=xibalba-liturgy-wall of gloom,
  Paradigm= Mind ,
  Save=  Y (see description) ,
  Duration= Markovian ,
  Counter=  n/a  ,
  Keywords= None ,
  Target=   Nearby or Far-Away area
]



You can anchor a barrier of pure darkness between three or more solid points up to \DICE meters in radius (for example: the 4 points of a door, two trees and the ground, across a hallway, etc).  Monsters that touch the blackness must immediately make a morale check with a -\DICE penalty or become Afraid for a Markovian duration.  Creatures that make their morale check that then continue through the wall must make a second Save; if they fail, they exit the wall the same way they came in (they will need to make a morale check again to touch the wall if they wish to try to move through it again).   

\newpage


\mysection{Miracle Working}{mystic-miracle-working}

\mybold{Use Faith Dice to perform Miracles.  No Miracles can take place on Unhallowed Earth}



\mysubsection{Ambrosia}{miracle-ambrosia}

You can create \DICE d4 \UD of Provisions.  These \UD can be combined into a single \UD (so 3 d4 \UD could be combined into a \UD of d12) up to a d24 \UD.  These Provisions can be stored for use later, but it also particularly nourishes the faithful.  During the working of the Miracle, up to \DICE Disciples of the Small God can partake of the Ambrosia and gain +1 Faith Die (the miracle worker cannot gain this benefit). Disciples partaking of the meal do not affect the \UD produced in any way.

\mysubsection{Covenant}{miracle-covenant}


The Mystic seals a bargain between themselves (referred to as the Suzerain) and another (referred to as the Vassal) by awarding temporary control over both of their *noumenon* to their Small God (this means that Fae cannot be held to a Covenant).  Free assent is required, but it can be compelled by other factors (like a dagger to the throat or other threats).

The Suzerain must use a number of \DICE equal to the \LVL of the Vassal, and this Miracle must take place in a shrine of their Small God.  Once complete:

\mylist { 
  \item The Suzerain can give Faith and take Faith from the Vassal, as if they were a Disciple
\item The Suzerain always knows where the Vassal is and (roughly) what they're generally feeling - strong emotions (lust, hatred, etc) or  physical extremes ("he's somewhere very, very cold")
\item The Suzerain is completely unable to harm the Vassal (though they can command others to do so); the Vassal does not have the same constraint.
\item The Vassal is immediately converted to the worship of the Small God
\item The Vassal barely needs sleep, and eats and drinks sparingly (roll Provisions \UD twice and take the higher roll).
\item The Vassal is affected as if they were under the effects of Tongues of Fire at all times
\item The Vassal gains +\SUMDICE points of "holy armor".  Damage is subtracted from this total first before it is applied to Armor, Grit, etc.  It can't be healed, but it is restored if the Vassal is able to visit a Shrine to their Small God during a Sojourn or Sabbatical.  
}

There can only be a single Covenant between the Suzerain and the Vassal - neither is allowed to strike a Covenant with anyone else while the Covenant is in effect.  The Covenant can only broken by: the Suzerain or the Vassal suffering a Crisis of Faith; the Suzerain and the Vassal agreeing to end the Covenant (both must agree); or the death of the Suzerain or the Vassal.



\mysubsection{Crusade}{miracle-crusade}

Can be performed by a Suzerain on their Vassal (see Covenant).  By invoking the Crusade, the Suzerain transforms the Vassal into a Paladin of the Faith.  

The Suzerain must use a number of \DICE equal to the \LVL of the Vassal, and this Miracle must take place in a shrine of the Small God.  In addition to the abilities they had before, Paladins can use Faith Die given to them by their Suzerain as Deed Dice in the same way as Sellswords (if the Paladin is a Sellsword, these Deed Dice are in addition to their regular Deed Dice, and can be rolled separately).  The Paladin is also capable of gaining Faith themselves, separately from their Suzerain.  Finally, the Paladin may cast any of the Seven Sacraments using their Faith Dice

This power does not come without cost.  The Suzerain must name a Crusade important to the Small God they worship: "wipe out the infidels of the Crawling Chaos", for example, or "bring the fingerbone of St. Sebastien to the reliquary in the Howling Wastes".  Similar to a Geas, any day not spent in the furtherance of the cause of the Crusade will lose the Paladin a single Faith die.  Note that if the Paladin should lose all their Faith and suffer a Crisis of Faith, the Crusade has failed, and the Covenant is broken.

\mysubsection{Golem}{miracle-golem}

A golem is a mortal-like figure, brought to life through magic.  Creating a golem requires gold for materials and effort, as well as a certain number of Ritual dice:

\mytable{X c c} {
  \thead{Type} & \thead{\COST} & \thead{Ritual Dice} \\
} {
  Paper  & 100au  & 10 \\
  Glass  & 500au  & 12 \\
  Wood  & 1,000au  & 14 \\
  Clay  & 5,000au  & 16 \\
}



Golems requires a *shem* - a slip of paper with a magical rune written on it through the miracle of the Holy Writ.

Golems are completely obedient to their Maker and respectful of any other follower of the Small God.  Presenting a holy symbol is enough to keep a Golem at bay, but only their Maker can give them commands.  If their Maker should perish, the golem will continue on in perpetuity, doing the last task given to it by its Maker.

\mybold{Golems are immune to magic of any kind - including being struck by magical weapons.}

\myhighlight{Paper Golem}{miracle-paper-golem}

Paper golems are small (less than 100cm tall) creatures created for menial work to fetch and carry for their Maker.  They can carry a single Significant Item provided it doesn't weight more than 5kg (or a number of Insignificant Items up to 5kg).  Paper golems can "fly" on gusts of wind (similar to how a chicken can "fly") and walk and run as fast as a small child.  Paper golems record everything they see.  At any time, their Maker can ask them a single question ("what was it you saw when you were in the Baron's chamber?", for example) and the golem will flatten itself into a scroll upon which is written what it "saw" (the Golem remains a scroll forever more, with the symbol of the Small God embossed on the bottom of the scroll.  These embossed scrolls are very, very difficult to counterfeit, and if you were to do so and get caught, it would bring about the wrath of the church of the Small God). 

Paper Golems are immediately destroyed by (non-magical) fire

\myhighlight{Glass Golem}{miracle-glass-golem}

Glass golems are mortal sized (2m tall) automatons filled with pungeant herbs and combustibles called "smokes".  The type of smoke is determined at the moment of their creation by their Maker. Glass golems immediately explode when dealt a forcible blow - a hit with a weapon, a fall from a height greater than 3m, etc.  The effect of exploding a Glass Golem deals d6 damage to everything Nearby (Save negates) as well as the following effects:

1. Smoke of Lies:  every creature Nearby is Befuddled and Enraged (1-3 on a d6) or Afraid (4-6 on a d6), unless they make a Save
2. Smoke of Heroes:  every creature Nearby receives a Blessing, and are immune to fear of any kind - but they cannot retreat.  Unwilling recipients get a Save
3. Smoke of the Holy: creates Hallowed ground everywhere Close to the point of explosion, or automatically dispels Unhallowed Earth somewhere Close.  Unhallowed creatures are thrown 10m Nearby (treat as Falling Damage).
4. Smoke of Medicines: every creature Nearby heals to their full Flesh, and restores 3d6 Grit up to their Max.

the smoke persists for Minutes, but can be dispersed by wind.  The Maker is not limited to these options; they should discuss with the Arbiter if they wish to go a different way.



\myhighlight{Wood Golem}{miracle-wood-golem}

Wood golems are large (3m tall) docile, hulking, tree-like creatures possessing great strength. They are able to carry up to 50 Significant Items in their branches, weighing up to 1,000kg total.  They can successfully break down non-magical doors, bend iron bars, and perform other feats of strength on a 4-in-6 (this number can be adjusted at the Arbiter's discretion).  They walk at a slow, shuffling gate (d4 \MD)

Wood golems will never attempt to defend themselves.  They can take up to 50 points of damage - Chopping weapons deal double-damage, and fire deals triple-damage.  They will glad and mindlessly stand wherever their Maker demands: in front of a doorway, in the middle of a fire, or charging dumbly into a group of Monsters.

\myhighlight{Clay Golem}{miracle-clay-golem}
Clay golems are giant (4m tall) faceless creatures created to protect or guard an area.  They must be told what they must guard at the moment of their creation, and they cannot stray further than 100m from that spot.  The spot they guard must be Hallowed, and if this ever ceases to be they will immediately crumble to dust.

Clay golems house the *noumenon* of a Vassal or Paladin of their Maker (see \mylink{Covenant}{miracle-covenant}) and \mylink{Crusade}{miracle-crusade}.  The Vassal or Paladin is ritually slain, and their blood given to the Maker, who combines it with sacred earth and fire to create the clay giant (the Vassal or Paladin does not need to be a willing sacrifice, though remember Mystics cannot directly harm their Vassals).  The golem has all of the memories, skills, saves, and abilities of their Mortal form (including Deed Dice, spell casting, etc.) and Grit, Flesh, etc.  They have a Soak: 2 and do 2d8 damage (2 Close).  They are immune to spells of the Mind paradigm, backstab, surprise, and toxins. They cannot speak and are unswervingly obedient to their Master.

Clay golems can be bestowed with the spirits of willing heroes (paladins who wish to protect the temple forever) or with those of unwilling enemies (forced to guard a forgotten hallway, or the temple of a heretic Small God).  When slain, the *noumenon* of the deceased do not travel to the Isle of the Dead.  None know what happens to their souls. 


\mysubsection{Hallowed Ground}{miracle-hallowed-ground}

The miracle is used to permanently consecrate Unhallowed Earth (see the Occult ritual for details), or to permanently create Hallowed ground for performing miracles.  The range is a circle \DICE meters in radius.  In order to consecrate Unhallowed Earth, this radius must equal or exceed the Unhallowed Earth the Mystic is trying to consecrate.  The ground to be consecrated must be within \DICE km of the Mystic.



Hallowed Ground has the following effects:

\mylist {
\item no Fae or Unhallowed creature may enter Hallowed Ground without making a Save.
\item any Mortal inside the radius of the Hallowed Ground can make a Save to end a Markovian effect (in addition to rolling the Markovian die)
\item any Mystics on Hallowed Ground may ignore the negative effect of a Failure when using  their Grace (that is, they may keep their Grace die even if they roll a 1 or a 2).
}

This Ritual is the only one that does *not* require Hallowed Ground to perform.


\mysubsection{Holy Relic}{miracle-holy-relic}

A repository for Faith.  By creating a Holy Relic with \DICE Ritual dice, you can place up to \DICE Faith dice into the relic.  You must place this Faith into the relic at the time of its creation.  This Faith can be used by other Mystics of your Small God (as well as yourself).  The relic itself must be something "special" - a fingerbone of a Saint, a shroud, etc.  (Arbiter's discretion).  The more powerful the relic, the more Faith can be placed inside of it.

The Miracle of the Holy Relic is used to create \mylink{Holy Symbols}{mystic-holy-symbol}.  The symbol must be what is indicated under your Small God.  A Holy Symbol only requires a single Ritual \DICE


\mysubsection{Holy Water}{miracle-holy-water}

You can create \DICE d4 \UD of Holy Water.  These \UD can be combined into a single \UD (so 3 d4 \UD could be combined into a \UD of d12) up to a d24 \UD.  For each Faith Die spent, you must spend an additional 25 coins in materials.

\mysubsection{Holy Writ}{miracle-holy-writ}

The word and the law of your Small God, written as seven sacred words known only to the faithful.  Only you and other members of your faith can see the words; to others, they look like random squiggles, strange designs, or "primitive" carvings.  Contained in the seven words is the performer of the Miracle, but you will need to make a successful Skill: Lore check to identify them unless you know them personally.   The Holy Writ only requires a single Faith.



\mysubsection{Incorruptibility}{miracle-incorruptibility}

Can only be performed on a corpse / someone who is already dead.  Incorruptibility stops a body from rotting.  The length of time depends on the number of Faith dice invested:  1 [die]: \SUMDICE Days; 2-5 \DICE: \SUMDICE Weeks; 6-9 \DICE: \SUMDICE Years; 10+ dice: \SUMDICE Centuries.  So long as the body remains on Hallowed ground, it does not decay in any way and cannot be targeted with any spells from the Necromancy paradigm.  If the body is removed from Hallowed ground, it will begin to decay as normal.

\mysubsection{Proselytize}{miracle-proselytize}

By invoking Proselytize, you can attempt to convert others to the faith of your Small God, or give willing congregants instruction in the ways of your religion.  

You can distribute no more than 1 of your Faith die to as many Mortals as you choose, provided they are not Mystics who follow a different Small God.  For each Mortal you transfer this Faith to, you must spend 1 Ritual die.

The effects vary depending on whether the congregant is willing, apathetic, or unwilling

\mylist {

\item Willing:  you give one of your Faith Die to the worshiper
\item Apathetic:  roll the Ritual Die; on a failure, the die is lost.  On success you have converted them - instead of giving your Faith Die to them, they gain one of their own
\item Unwilling:  the congregant gets a Save.  If they succeed, you lose 2 Faith Die (the original you tried to give them, plus one other).  If they fail, roll as "Apathetic" above - if you succeed in converting them, you gain +1 Faith
}

Worshipers who have a Faith Die from you become your Disciple (see the Core Rules for details).

\mysubsection{Sacred Mass}{miracle-sacred-mass}

You can perform a sacred ceremony for \SUMDICE others (excluding yourself).  Non-Mystics who indulge in a Sacred Mass are Blessed for the next Session.  If you are a Mysic of a different Small God then the miracle worker and partake in the Mass, you lose 2 Faith Die.  If you are the miracle worker, or a Mystic of the same Small God, you gain 1 Faith Die for every 10 people participating up to your \LVL.




\mysubsection{Sin Eating}{miracle-sin-eating}

You can heal up to \DICE Spirit Wounds on yourself or others Nearby.



\mysubsection{Tongues of Fire}{miracle-tongues-of-fire}

Up to \SUMDICE people other than the Miracle Worker are affected.  Recipients of Tongues of Fire can speak (but not read) any Language they choose at will, and can command a single creature once per Session (see below).  The recipient can never lie while under the effects of Tongues of Flame.  Unwilling creatures get a Save.  This miracle lasts only for the Session (unless provided by Covenant)



\LITURGY [
  Name= Command,
  Link=miracle-command,
  Paradigm=Mind,
  Save=Y,
  Duration=0 ,
  Counter= n/a  ,
  Keywords=None ,
  Target=Nearby creature
]

You shout a \DICE word command to the target, who must then carry it out if the fail a Save.  If the command would last more than a single Moment, the target gets a new Save at the beginning of each Moment.
