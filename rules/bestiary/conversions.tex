  The First Men are a mashup of beasts found in Rakehell, Dolmenwood, and Beneath the Missing Sea. They are the "Restless Dead of man's ambitious birth form, crypt things and specters, the undead. Scabrous and rotting, they seek to avenge old crimes, to herald dark times, and to feel for a moment the joys of life long lost".

    \mybold{Commanding Presence:} All First Men can command up to \HD other Horrors, Shades, or Walking Dead, provided their individual \HD does not exceed their own (for example, a 4 \HD First Man could command up to 4 undead who have up to 4 \HD).  
    
    \mybold{Terrifying:}  The First Men prompt a Sanity roll when seen.

    \mybold{Unhallowed:}  Arguably the very definition of Unhallowed

    The Thing from the Deep attacks all targets Close and Nearby with its tentacles.  It's modestly intelligent i.e. it knows mortals need to breathe.  The body itself is in the water.

    If \MAX damage is rolled, the creature grabs ahold of the adventurer.  The adventurers can make a \RB using \VIG to escape at the bottom of each Moment.

    If the player is held at the top of any Moment, one of the following happens (random, or utilize the creature's intelligence):

    \mynumlist {
      \item Holds the adventurer under the water.  They start to drown.  Roll your \VIG - if you fail, you fall unconscious.  You must roll a Save vs. Doom every Moment afterwards to keep yourself off Death's Door.  If you fail, you fall to Death's Door and must roll your Death Die at the top of every following Moment, or perish.

      \item Throw the adventurer against the wall, or dash them on the ground.  Equivalent of falling 10m.  

      \item Squeeze the adventurer for d6 damage (bypasses Grit).

      \item Bludgeon another adventurer with the one held in its tentacle as a free attack.  If the Thing hits, the adventurer rolls their \VIG - this much damage is applied to both the adventurer struck, and the one held in its tentacles.
    }

    The Thing is cowardly, however - every time the creature takes 7+ points of damage from a single attack, roll its morale.  It will sink beneath the waves for Minutes before resurfacing again. The creatures heals 3 Health at the bottom of every Moment, as long as it is in water

    Silent and ruthless.  Sinister, looming humanoids, cloaked in ragged black, with stag-skull heads (featuring a full set of antlers) and bony claws. Antler wraiths haunt rings of old standing stones, servants of grim, forgotten gods. They seek out warm-blooded sentients whom they drag to their stone rings for sacrifice. Antler wraiths only manifest at nighttime â€” coalescing out of mist. At dawn (or upon death), they evaporate once more. However, tampering with their standing stones or unearthing their treasure hoards (the remains of their victims, carefully buried nearby) will summon antler wraiths in Minutes, even during daylight hours.

    \mybold{Life draining touch:} In addition to damage, the touch of an antler wraith drops any Intangible Stat (player choice) \DCDOWN

  Those chosen by the Sea Monk will hear its song like the sound of crashing waves.

Failing 2 Sanity checks worsens the compulsion.  In time, the adventurer is compelled to drown themselves in saltwater.

  The Sea Monk prefers to pick adventurers off one by one, starting with companions and retainers.  It moves silently and conceals itself in shadow (3-in-6).
