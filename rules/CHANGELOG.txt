2020-04-25: Added new Witch Necromancy spells: Exploding Corpse and Zombie Warrior.  Reduced the difficulty of casting Zombie Slave spell. (thanks Lou!)
2020-04-25: Witch starting Mojo moved to d8 (thanks Lou!)
2020-04-25: Reworked Knave Die to avoid the "picking the gates of Hell at level 5" scenario.  Reworked Knave abilities as "Whispers" or Knave magic.  Bravos and Knaves now share climb walls, sneak, open locks, and find/disarm traps.  Bravos have a disguise/forgery ability, Archaeologists have a sleight of hand ability.  Moved the Archaeologist ability to carry cursed items to level 1.  Level 3 Archaeologist can make a "bag of holding", Level 3 Bravo can create a knife from shadows.  Finally, allow Bravos to use War Axe, Mace, and Spear to backstab.  (thanks Eric!)
2020-04-25: Moved finding traps back to Knaves.
2020-04-25: Rewrote Charms to be less esoteric in their titles, and combined a few redundant ones. (thanks Lou!)

2020-01-22: Under Archaeologist, changed scrolls to: You can attempt to cast spells from Sorcerer's scrolls. Instead of rolling d6 however, you roll up to your [level]d4 (so if you were level 4, you could roll up to 4d4). The same rules apply for triples (Mishaps), quadruples (Calamity), and quintuples (Ruin) as they do for Sorcerers.
