%%% CHARMS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\newpage


  \mysection{Charms}{arcana-charms}

  You can perform Charms at will.  Casting a Charm takes Moments.  In Combat, invoking a Charm is a Combat Maneuver.


  \mysubsection{Aphrodite’s Sigh}{charm-aphrodites-sigh}

  By means of this spell you can create a ghostly moaning sound that appears to come from somehere Nearby. The moan is not loud nor can it quite cause fear, but any that hear it will know of it's "unnatural" nature. 

  \mysubsection{Candlelight}{charm-candlelight}

  This spell creates a small mote of light roughly equal to candle light that hovers near your head. The spell is typically used for reading or lighting a small area (half a cubic meter). This charm cannot be cast into someone's eyes. The light is dim enough that it's not particularly useful for lighting dark passages unless that passage is very well known (such as the your own home). 

  \mysubsection{Creature Comforts}{charm-creature-comforts}

  You can raise or lower the temperature of any non-living material a few degrees, enough to warm or cool food or drinks or a room.  The temperature cannot be raised to a degree where it would injure anyone.


  \mysubsection{Dowsing)}{charm-dowsing}

  Using a forked wand of hazelwood, you can sense the direction of a substantial body of potable water.  It ignores "insignificant" amounts of water, as found in a waterskin or barrel.  The spell doesn’t tell you how hard it might be to get to the water.

  \mysubsection{Fastening}{charm-fastening}

  This spell allows you to close one door or window that is not locked or otherwise barred. This will not lock the door or window unless by the action of closing it naturally becomes locked. 

  \mysubsection{Flame of Vesta}{charm-flame-of-vesta}

  You may change a fire into one of black flame, so that it casts no light but still provides heat.  You can affect a normal fire up to the size of a campfire.  Furthermore, the flames do not burn, though they are uncomfortable to the touch.

  \mysubsection{Jinx}{charm-jinx}

  You can perform a minor hex by tracing a five pointed star in the air with your forefinger. The hex can affect something Nearby or closer.  These hexes can be severing a rope, shattering a pane of glass, spoiling a piece of food, or some other small act of malice.  Note that these hexes will not work if there is a Pooka nearby

  \mysubsection{Levitate}{charm-levitate}

  You may use this spell to lift an object via magic alone. The object needs to be non-living and weigh less than 1kg. The object will remain floating in mid-air for up to 1 Hour as long as you are paying at least some attention to it. If you are distracted at all, say in Combat or casting another spell (including another Charm) then the object drops. 

  \mysubsection{Matchstick}{charm-matchstick}

  When you drag your forefinger along a rough surface and says the name of Buer, your fingertip combusts like a giant phosphorus match. It burns for a Moment and does not hurt you in any way.

  \mysubsection{Message}{charm-message}

  By means of this spell you can send a brief message, no more than a dozen words, to a person you know. This person can be any distance away, but they have to be able to understand the language of the message you're sending.

  \mysubsection{Puff of Air}{charm-puff-of-air}

  This spell creates a small puff of air; enough to blow away dust from objects or to put out a candle, but not enough to put out a torch or lantern. The puff can move very light items as would a puff of air blown from natural means. This spell can be used to blow dirt from an item or area 1m by 1m. 

  \mysubsection{Spice}{charm-spice}

  This minor spell flavors one serving of food. The flavor can be changed but it does not change the nature of the food item nor does make poisoned food or spoiled food edible, similar to Freshen. The flavor can be chosen by you. 

  \mysubsection{Sweet Dreams}{charm-sweet-dreams}
  This spell allows you to make a willing creature fall asleep. The spell will not work if used against an unwilling subject. You can cast this spell on yourself, but this will be the last spell that you cast that day.

  If used on a subject who is already asleep, you can breathe in their ear and control what dreams they have the following night. No matter how unpleasant the dreams, this cannot prevent the victim from getting a full night’s rest on its own, but it can affect their mood.

  \mysubsection{Third Eye}{charm-third-eye}

  By holding or touching an inanimate object and concentrating for Minutes, you can detect whether or not something is magical in nature, or if something can "hold" an enchantment (including staves, swords, and holy relics).  

  Alternately, you can use this charm to "see" any Nearby concealed objects, like secret doors and hidden compartments.  The Charm doesn't detect invisible or magically concealed objects. 


  \mysubsection{Tidy}{charm-tidy}

  This spell can be used to clean a single object. The object can be anything, clothing, armor, weapons or even a area of a home. Unlike other Charms this one can be cast on a willing living participant. A warlock casting clean on themselves will appear as they would if they had recently bathed and donned fresh clothing. This spell can clean 1 cubic meter of space or an area 3m x 3m. 

  Alternately, you can fix minor wear and tear in non-living and non-metal apparel, fixing small rips and tears as if you were using a needle and thread.  The amount of material mended cannot exceed 1 cubic meter.  You cannot fix a dented piece of armor or sharpen a sword, but you could fix a pane of glass if all the pieces are present, or reattach a broken strap of a backpack

  Finally, you can use this charm to "freshen" one object up to 1 cubic meter. Typical uses are to remove the wrinkles in a garment, brighten the color or some non-living object, or even make bland food more favorable, or polishing metal or glass. All these effects are considered to be a minor illusion. This spell cannot make poisoned or spoiled food edible. 

  \mysubsection{Turkish Delight}{charm-turkish-delight}

  You can create a single piece of food or drink, such as a Turkish delight, a piece of fruit, or glass of wine. It is exquisitely delicious and provides no nourishment whatsoever. If not eaten within Minutes, it dissolves into black smoke.  If you have a Toxin, you can use it on this food.

  \mysubsection{Unbolting}{charm-unbolting}

  This spell creates allows you to open one door, window, chest or other item that is not locked or otherwise barred. 

  \mysubsection{Watchdog}{charm-watchdog}

  You can place an area of alarm around themselves.  Any creature larger than a cat that comes Close or Nearby to you sets off a mental alarm that will wake you up from non-magical sleep.  You will not know what has entered the circle, but you will know something has, and the the general direction.

Davy Jones Locker, Iron Anchor, Mermaid's Breath, and Three Teeth

\LITURGY [
  Name= Davy Jones Locker,

  Paradigm= Prophesy ,
  Save=  N ,
  Duration= 0 ,
  Counter=  n/a  ,
  Keywords= None ,
  Target=   Close body of water
]



You must be near a body of water to use this liturgy (a river is OK, a puddle isn't).  You summon a lock up to \DICE meters in length, width, and height.  The box can hold up to \DICE X100kg in weight, or about 25 Significant Items (provided the box is big enough in terms of height, width, and depth i.e. you could put a 2 meter long pole in a 1 [die] locker).  Once you seal the box and carve your name onto it, the waters will take the locker back beneath the surface, where it will disappear.  At any time, you can return to the same body of water and bring the locker back from the depths. Nothing else can bring the locker back from the deeps (not even the liturgy of Dredge) except your death.  When you die, the locker will wash up on shore within a few days for some lucky (or unlucky) soul to find.
If you place a living thing inside, it can breathe - but it will starve or die of thirst without food or water (incidentally, this is a great way to make vodyanoi)
\LITURGY [
  Name= Iron Anchor,
  Link=ikitikbubuoe-liturgy-liturgy-iron-anchor,
  Paradigm= Force ,
  Save=  N ,
  Duration= \SUMDICE Minutes ,
  Counter=  n/a  ,
  Keywords= None ,
  Target=   Close (touch)
]



You summon an immensely heavy iron anchor weighing \DICE X100kg.  You have to summon it onto a stable surface - for example, you couldn't summon it by touching water or sand, but you could summon it on top of a flimsy wooden railing.  The anchor will disappear at the end of the liturgy's duration.
\LITURGY [
  Name= Mermaid's Breath,
  Link=ikitikbubuoe-liturgy-liturgy-mermaids-breath,

  Save=  Y (negates) ,
  Duration= \SUMDICE Minutes ,
  Counter=  n/a  ,
  Keywords= Splittable ,
  Target=   Self / Close (touch)
]



For \SUMDICE Minutes, up to \DICE+1 Allies or Monsters (including yourself) can breathe water as if it were air.  They can only breathe water, however - breathing air will cause them to drown. Unwilling creatures get a Save to negate.  You must touch the Creature to bestow this liturgy upon them. 
\LITURGY [
  Name= Trident of Ik'tik'buboe,
  Link=ikitikbubuoe-liturgy-trident,
  Paradigm= Force ,
  Save=  N ,
  Duration= Session ,
  Counter=  n/a  ,
  Keywords= None ,
  Target=   Self
]



A magical trident appears in your hand that only you can wield.  The trident is a 2-handed weapon that deals \DICE+\DICE damage up to a maximum of 12. You must make a successful Fight check using your \FOC (instead of \VIG or \DEX). Every time the trident strikes a creature, its damage goes down by 1.  When it hits 0, the trident disappears.  The trident can strike creatures who are only struck by magical weapons, but because there is no die to roll when dealing damage, it cannot Crit or be Fumbled.

You become as one born of the grave.  You can speak Graveborn, breathe dirt as if it were air, have Darkvision, and grow long, black claws that you can attack with for 2d4 damage in Combat.  Additionally, these claws can dig 5m every Minute in any direction through ground as hard as packed earth.  

You are considered Unhallowed for the duration of the necromancy.  Other Undead will ignore you.  The Necromancy must run its course, it cannot be ended at will.

  Target=Corpse in a boat
]


This spell requires a rowboat, 2 gold coins, and an open body of water (roughly the size of a lake).  If a corpse is placed in the rowboat with two gold coins on its eyes and pushed out into the water, it will return an hour later, empty. There will be no trace of the corpse anywhere, no evidence left in the boat, and people will forget the corpse even existed.

  Link=necromancy-corpse-smoke,
  Paradigm=Death,
  Save=N,
  Duration=0,
  Mod=+3,
  Keywords=None,
  Target=Close (touch) Mortal corpse
]


You remove the dead flesh from a corpse and smoke it.  The corpse must be fresh (with a few hours of death) and you must have a pipe.   You gain all the Skills, languages, and memories of the corpse for for the rest of the Session.  You do not gain any spells or supernatural abilities, or Class abilitie. If the creature was magical or particularly strong-willed, you must Save vs. Hexes or gain some aspect of the creature's personality for the duration. If the creature was over 100 years old, you must \RS : Sanity.  This spell consumes the corpse.

\NECRO[

  Link=necromancy-death-mask,
  Paradigm=Death,

You touch a corpse and the face peels off like a mask (and can be worn as one) while the rest of the corpse is consumed.

  Link=necromancy-death-scythe
  Paradigm=Death,
  Save=N,
  Duration=Until Exhausted,
  Mod=+3,
  Keywords=None,
  Target=Close (touch) corpse
]


The corpse disintegrates as you pluck a black scythe from its center of mass. The scythe is 2 Handed and does d8 damage; this d8 is a \UD - when you exhaust the \UD, the scythe disappears.  Against Monsters of the same type, the scythe has the Weapon Trait: Cleave (for example, a scythe made from a troll corpse would have Cleave against trolls.) The scythe is only usable by you and counts as a magic weapon; it does not count as a Significant Item. You must make a successful Fight check using your \FOC (instead of \VIG or \DEX) to hit with the weapon. This spell consumes the corpse.

\NECRO[
  Name=Essential Salt,
  Link=necromancy-essential-salt,
  Paradigm=Death,
  Save=N,
  Duration=Permanent,
  Mod=+9,
  Keywords=None,
  Target=Close (touch) corpse
]


You reduce a corpse into a coarse grit that can be stored in a tiny pouch or vial. You can cast Speak with Dead to speak with the spirit as many times as you want (normally you are limited to one attempt per corpse). This requires you to spread the salt out on a flat surface; be mindful it doesn't get blown away or mixed in with mundane sand. After several conversations, spirits tend to regain much of their memory, personality, and goals. This spell consumes the corpse.

\NECRO[
  Name=Exploding Corpse,
  Link=necromancy-exploding-corpse,
  Paradigm=Death,
  Save=N,
  Duration=0,
  Mod=+9,
  Keywords=None,
  Target=Nearby Corpse
]

You cause a corpse to explode in a shower of bone and blood. Anyone Close to the corpse must \RO their \MD + \DEX or take \LVL x2 damage.  Makes a really big fucking mess.  Corpse is consumed.

\NECRO[
  Name=Eyes of the Dead,
  Link=necromancy-eyes-of-the-dead,
  Paradigm=Death,
  Save=N,
  Duration=Session,
  Mod=+9,
  Keywords=None,
  Target=Close (touch) corpse
]


You remove one of your own eyes from your head and place it in the empty eye socket of a dead creature (including a Zombie Slave). For the duration of the spell you can see through the eye of the corpse.  When the spell ends, or if the corpse is consumed, your eye is returned to you.

\NECRO[
  Name=Knit Flesh,
  Link=necromancy-knit-flesh,
  Paradigm=Death,
  Save=N,
  Duration=0/Session,
  Mod=+9,
  Keywords=None,
  Target=Close (touch) creature
]


Heal 1 \HD of Flesh on a single creature. The creature you're healing needs to make a \RS Sanity.  The healed flesh will appear grey and bloodless; wounds are sealed with wire and crude staples.  Horrible scars are usually left behind. You can only do this once per creature during a Breather or Bivouac (before you restore any Mojo).

You can also use this Necromancy to stitch a lost limb or hand to a stump.  This requires an available limb of the appropriate size.  The limb rots quickly and a new one needs to be attached each Session.  The Witch also can "feel" what the limb feels (i.e. they can tell if the creature is holding something [but not what], if the creature is walking or running, etc).  While the stitched limb is attached, the creature is Unhallowed.


\NECRO[
  Name=Necrography,
  Link=necromancy-necrography,
  Paradigm=Death,
  Save=N,
  Duration=\LVL Minutes,
  Mod=+6,
  Keywords=None,
  Target=Close (touch) Mortal corpse
]

The touched corpse is compelled to answer \LVL questions.  The body only speaks in Graveborn. The body will answer honestly, but flesh bodies technically see/hear/experience everything the living body does, but they only remember things that involve food, sex, pain, adrenaline responses, and stuff like that. Usually the corpse will talk using it's normal mouth, but it may also communicate the response in other ways. It's always understandable, although sometimes a bit cryptic.  This spell consumes the corpse

\NECRO[
  Name=Speak with Dead,
  Link=necromancy-speak-with-dead,
  Paradigm=Death,
  Save=N,
  Duration=\LVL x2 Minutes,
  Mod=+3,
  Keywords=None,
  Target=Close (touch) Mortal corpse
]


You can converse freely with any corpse that has an intact jaw, but only in Graveborn. The words of the dead tend to be cryptic and unhelpful, especially if the creature has no reason to help you. Corpses usually don't remember exactly how they died. Corpses can only speak Graveborn.  This spell consumes the corpse

\NECRO[
  Name=Worthless Corpse,
  Link=necromancy-worthless-corpse,
  Paradigm=Death,
  Save=N,
  Duration=Session,
  Mod=+0,
  Keywords=None,
  Target=Close (touch) Mortal corpse
]


Sometimes it's not enough to be dead - corpses can be resources. This spell makes the body of the target appear not simply dead, but utterly worthless, not worth investigating, without even marrow to crack open and eat. If the Witch casts this spell on themselves, all observers (including allies ) will believe the caster to be dead, even if they saw them casting the spell. Should the ‘corpse’ get up and walk it will provoke horror and uncomprehending disgust (and a \RS: Sanity). All present, including allies, will compulsively attack the target until the target is destroyed.  The spell cannot be ended at will by the Witch - its duration must run its course

\NECRO[
  Name=Zombie Slave,
  Link=necromancy-zombie-slave,
  Paradigm=Death,
  Save=N,
  Duration=Session,
  Mod=+9,
  Keywords=None,
  Target=Close (touch) corpse
]


You can raise a corpse to help with mundane tasks, test for traps, etc.  The corpse moves very slowly (d3 \MD) but doesn't need to eat, sleep, rest, or breathe.  The corpse cannot Fight or Guard, and any damage to it (including Curse the Unhallowed) immediately ends the spell.  The corpse has the strength of a normal person and can carry 25kg worth of stuff without tiring, but it'll need to be strapped to them (in a backpack or whatever).  Arbiter gets final say on what's allowed. The corpse can obey one word commands i.e. "dig", "sit", "go", "stop", etc.  The corpse can only understand Graveborn. It is completely mindless and extremely literal. The corpse will obey your last command until the spell's duration expires.  When the spell ends, the corpse falls to the ground, but is not consumed.

\NECRO[
  Name=Zombie Warrior,
  Link=necromancy-zombie-warrior,
  Paradigm=Death,
  Save=N,
  Duration=Combat,
  Mod=+6,
  Keywords=Conc.,
  Target=Close (touch) corpse
]

You can raise a corpse to fight for you. The Corpse acts as a Zombie under your control for the duration of Combat.  You must maintain Concentration to control the zombie, and the zombie uses your Mojo to Fight and Guard.  You can raise as many zombies as you wish, but each uses your Mojo to Fight/Guard.  If you run out of Mojo, are incapacitated, or the spell ends the corpse falls to the ground and is immediately consumed.

    Up to \DICE Unhallowed creatures take \SUMDICE + \DICE damage (Save for half).  You can divide this damage up any way you like.

    \example {
      Oberlan Xi, Mystic of Pilzesser, performs the sacrament of Curse the Unhallowed on a ghoul and a group of skeletons. He rolls 3 d4 Grace dice in the attempt and gets a 9 - adding the number of \DICE he rolled, this becomes a 12 (9+3).  He can affect up to 3 creatures, and decides to deal 6 damage to the ghoul and 3 damage to two of the skeletons (he could also have just dealt 12 damage to the ghoul if he preferred).

Throw and Shoot weapons, and can absorb up to \SUMDICE + \DICE damage before
it dissipates.  You can also Sunder this shield (like the Combat ability),

A marble-sized bead of poo lands at a Nearby or Far-Away point you select. 
You can cause the sphere to detonate at any time in \DICE Hours (including

Save or immediately become Sickened, and the area is filled with a thick

small purple and gold tent, a small table and chair, a kettle, a cookpot
with a stew going, an iron arm to hold the kettle or cookpot over a fire, a
book entitled "The Erotic Poems of Plumtarch" (less erotic than expected),
and a pair of dry wool socks for up to \DICE people. Any items removed from
the area vanish instantly. In the spell's area, the temperature is moderated
very slightly, wind and rain are lessened, and vermin cannot enter.  The
tents are immune to casual attack, including from wandering Monsters (anyone
sleeping outside the tents might not be so lucky).  Up to \DICE people

A beam of force erupts from your forehead and strikes something you can see,
pushing it backwards. Every Moment, the creature or object is pushed 5m in
the direction you are looking.  If it's an object, you can push up to \DICE

You roll a small orb of Entropy to a point Nearby or Far-Away; the orb rolls
silently and is hard to see.  At any time for the next \SUMDICE Hours, you
can have the orb detonate into an incredibly loud clattering, wailing, and
whistling. Creatures Close to the designated point must Save or be Stunned
for \DICE Moments. It is audible in clear air up to a \DICE km away. You can
designate \DICE conditions under which the orb will detonate. For example,
you could say "now"; "if anyone steps on it"; or "if water touches it".  The
conditions must be obvious and must occur within 1m of the orb. When the

Ensorcel one or more Monsters whose combined \HD is less than or equal to
\DICE.  Save negates; otherwise, they will regard you as a good friend and
ignore the obvious spell you just cast on them.  The effect lasts for the
entire Session unless you ask them to do something they might think was a
little weird: attack an ally, let you through an area they're supposed to be
guarding, etc. (this is up to the Arbiter's discretion).  This prompts a
Contested roll by the victim, using \FOC with a -\DICE penalty.  You must
touch the targets' flesh (like with a handshake) to cast the spell.  The
charmed person must stay Close, Neary, or Far-Away from you - if you ever

You emit \DICE sprays of color from your fingertips that you can split among
\DICE Monsters.  For each Monster, if the \SUMDICE of the \DICE targeting
the Monster is twice as much (equal to or greater) as the Monster's \HD, it
is Befuddled (the duration is Markovian and depends on the number of dice
invested).  If \SUMDICE is three times the Monster's \HD, it is Stunned for
a Moment, then Befuddled as above. If \SUMDICE is five times the creature's
\HD, it is Stunned (the duration is Markovian and depends on the number of

You grow +\DICE meters in height, and your features and voice become
terrible and commanding.  Creatures of less than \DICE \HD must test morale
or flee in terror.  You can use your \INT in place of any rolls where you
would normally use \VIG.  If you enter the radius of Balthazar's

You can summon a Bashing, Cutting, or Stabbing weapon of Force.  You can
change the type of weapon by using 1 Maneuver in Combat.  The weapon does
\DICE damage and can hit creatures only affected by magic.  Only you can
fight with the Ego Weapon.   You must make a successful
Fight check using your \INT (instead of \VIG or \DEX) to hit with the weapon. 
A Helping Hand can wield an Ego Weapon, but you can only have 1 Ego Weapon
in existence at a time.  The weapon lasts for the entire Session.  It can be
dispelled by a Greaseball if a Wizards' Duel is lost; it will dispel an

Often used to target Sorcerers or seriously magical creatures (unicorns,
dragons, etc).  In the case of Sorcerers, they take \DICE damage for each
unspent Blood pool they possess; in the case of a magical Monster, they take
\SUMDICE+\DICE.  Save for half damage, but Sorcerers who fail their Save
must also immediately roll their remaining Blood die as if they were casting
a spell (any rolls of a 1 or a 2 loses the die; if you roll doubles a Mishap
occurs; etc) though no spell will actually be cast.   Non-magical creatures,

You summon a bank of swirling and shifting fog that exists for as long as
you concentrate.  The fog can move with you, or you can mentally direct it
to move Nearby (takes 1 Maneuver).  The fog will blanket \SUMDICE creatures
or a space \DICE+\DICE meters cubed.  Missiles that are thrown or shot into
the fog strike a random target; nothing can be thrown or shot out of the
fog.  The fog extinguishes small flames (torches, candles, etc)  Creatures
who attempt to Fight while inside of the fog act as if they were Befuddled;
however, anyone attempting to Skulk and Murder someone else in the fog
succeeds automatically.

You project \DICE will-o'the-wisps into an area Close or Nearby.  The wisps
can move one range (Close to Nearby, Nearby to Far Away, etc) each Moment
for as long as you concentrate.  You can split the wisps up any way you like
but they can't be more than Far-Away from you.  The wisps do not shed heat,
do not require air, and can't be doused by water.  They shed a steady yellow
light the brightness of a torch.  At the top of the Moment, you can command
up to \DICE wisps to Befuddle up to \DICE Monsters.  The Monsters
immediately get a Save to negate (one for each wisp that's targetting them),
but a successful Save does not end the spell.  If any of the wisps are
struck by an Enervate spell, they are all dispelled if a Wizards' Duel is

Toss a small ball of grease at a point on the ground Close or Nearby. If you
would prefer to throw the ball at a person or object, make a Fight \RO using
your \INT - if you miss, it dissapates.  If thrown at the ground, the
surface becomes slick with a thick oil; anyone attempting to move through
the area must \RO using \DEX+\MD with a -\DICE penalty or immediately fall
Prone.  It requires a successful \RO to get up again.  If you throw it at a
creature, the effect is as above, plus they can't hold anything without
dropping it.  If you throw it at an object, the object becomes impossible to
carry or hold until the grease is removed with a mild or strong acid. 
Pritchard's Gusty Belch (acid variety) will dispel the grease if a Wizards'
Duel is lost; the grease is also highly flammable.

Forks of lightning erupt from your oustretched hands, striking a Close or
Nearby target for \SUMDICE damage (Save for half). You can cause the
lightning to "jump" up to \DICE-1 times to another creature or object Close
by, provided they are conductive (iron armor, metal ladders, etc).  Magic
swords aren't conductive.  You can "ping-pong" between two objects if you
desire. Creatures struck by this secondary lightning bolt take \DICE damage
(no Save). Objects struck by this secondary lightning bolt will become
momentarily electrified, and deal a shock that could cause someone to lose
their grip unless they \RO : \VIG + \FOC with a -\DICE penalty.

You create a spectral mule out of pure Force energy. The mule carries two
magical saddlebags that can each hold \SUMDICE Significant Items whose
combined weight doesn't exceed \DICE x 200kg (a reminder that a person is 25
Significant Items, and small creatures are 15).  The mule walks at a briks
trot.  It will stop and turn at your verbal command, but you cannot make it
reverse or slow down. You can only give it the commands "go", "stop",
"left", and "right". If the mule takes any damage, it immediately disappears
and drops all the items on the ground.  The mule will obey your last command
until the spell's duration expires.  Hammerspace Mules think that Illusions
are real; if the Illusion would damage them in some way (a pit they would
fall into, a spear they would run into, etc) the Mule is dispelled (dropping
its items on the ground) if a Wizards' Duel is lost.

You can detach your hand from its wrist (your choice as to which one).  The
hand floats at chest height and can hold anything you could normally hold. 
The hand can't use any weapons except for an Ego Weapon.  It can grab
shirts, press buttons, and shove people (but not too hard).  If anyone
attacks the hand, you have to roll your Guard as if they were attacking you. 
If your hand takes any damage, it disappears for the rest of the Session. 
Additionally, if the Hand is ever caught in a Web spell, it will disappear
if a Wizards' Duel is lost.  At the end of the Session, roll a d6.  On a 1

You and up to \DICE-1 allies can leap \VIG+\SUMDICE meters high and/or
\VIG+\SUMDICE meters forward in a straight line.  You take no damage on
landing, provided you land on or above the level you started from. For
example, you could leap from the ground to top of a steeple, or you could
leap over the steeple to land on the ground, but you couldn't leap from the
top of a steeple to the ground.  When you land, you can make a \RS : \DEX

you can leap again. You can do this up to \DICE times.  You can't cast

You brain disappears and your head has a hinge that opens like a box, but
only you know this and only you can open it. For the rest of the Session,
you are immune to the next \DICE spells from the Mind paradigm, and you can
fit up to \SUMDICE Significant Items inside of your head in Hammerspace

final Mind paradigm spell, the enchantment immediately ends. If the spell
ends while items are stored in your head they will mix with your
brain-matter. Usually this is fatal, though ambitious Sorcerers sometimes
add drugs.  While your head is hollow, another Sorcerer could read the

Throw a bolt of ice at a target Close or Nearby.  The bolt will travel in a
straight line from your fingers.  Anything touched by the bolt takes
\SUMDICE damage, Save for half.  Additionally, everything that fails its
Save is frozen to whatever surfaces they are touching.Keys are frozen in
their locks; swords are frozen to hands; boots are frozen to the ground

]



You create an illusion of anything you desire. If anything touches the
illusion, it will pass through it with no effect.  The illusion cannot be
greater than \DICE x \DICE meters in size.  Think of the illusion as a
perfectly accurate hologram that you are creating - the illusion can be
heard in addition to being seen, can perform the same action over and over
again, and can deliver messages, but it can't interact in a meaningful way
or perform complex actions based on external forces. 

Each aspect of the illusion requires one or more Blood die to cast:

\mylist {
  \item You want the illusion to say up to \DICE + \DICE words or make \DICE
+ \DICE sounds (wailing, shouting, etc)
  \item You want the illusion to be a physical thing (hole in the ground,
stone wall, orc guard, etc)
  \item You want the illusion to be able to move up to \DICE meters
  \item You want to cast the illusion on a living creature (disguise them as
a beggar or a lamp post)
}

Note that there is some Arbiter's discretion here.  A guard pacing in front
of a door might cost 2 \DICE (a physical thing moving back and forth 2
meters), but if you want the illusion of acrobats or pouncing lions it will
be more costly.  A disguise cast on someone to appear to be a beggar might
cost 1 [die] (a living creature wearing the face and clothing of a random
beggar), but disguising yourself as the king will be significantly harder.

The Illusion will last for \DICE Hours.  Anyone touching the illusion will
immediately know it to be fake, but this doesn't cause the illusion to
disappear.  However, if the illusion is touched with an Ego Weapon, it will
disappear if a Wizards' Duel is lost.

Up to \DICE objects or creatures can be made invisible (including yourself),
and will remain that way as long as they don't move.  As soon as the
creature or object moves (or is moved), the charm is broken.  Invisible
creatures can see other invisible and hidden objects (including Skulking
Knaves).  If this spell is cast on something Invisible, it will force the

\DICE Days; 5 \DICE: Weeks; 6+ \DICE: Forever.  The wisps from a Fool's Fire

You summon a cloud of tiny, magical, irritating vermin to an area Close,
Nearby, or Far-Away.  The vermin deal \DICE damage per Moment to every
living creature Close to them, but no damage to nonliving creatures or
objects. At the top of each Moment they are in the cloud, a non-mindless
creature must Save or take a -\DICE penalty on their Fight roll.  The vermin
won't move from the spot where they are summoned, and will remain until the
spell expires.  If the target is an object, the vermin will do minor
cosmetic damage, such as chewing holes in paper, gnawing wood, chipping
paint, and scratching glass.  Mighty Lungs will dispel the swarm if a

Up to \DICE daggers orbit your head like a halo or crown.  These must be
daggers in your possession.  Magic and silver daggers are OK, as are other
"dagger-like" items (icicles, shards of glass, etc) at the Arbiter's
discretion.  At any time during the Session, you can mentally "throw" one or
more of these daggers at things that are Close, Nearby, or Far-Away with
unerring accuracy.  This could be used to sever a rope or pin something to a
wall (or stick into someone's chest) - but no Gambits, that wouldn't be
fair.  Each dagger does \SUMDICE+\DICE damage i.e. if you were to throw 1
dagger at someone, it would do d6+1, two daggers 2d6+2, etc.  Grimm's

You draw a circle \DICE meters in radius in the air. The inside of the
circle is made of Force, as solid as iron. You can cause the circle to
raise, lower, or hover in place.  You can only move up and down (never
side-to-side).  Up to \DICE people could stand under it and be completely
covered, or on it and be moved provided they don't weigh more than \DICE
x200kg.  If you lower the circle on top of someone, they take \DICE damage
per Moment. The circle moves 10 meters a minute (about 3m per Moment).  You
can draw the circle in any orientation, and you can change its orientation
at any time.  If the Levitating Disc is targeted with Suspend Objects, the
disc will be dispelled if a Wizards' Duel is lost.

Your flesh becomes gelatinous. You can squeeze through gaps as small as

Up to \DICE non-living thing slam shut and can't be opened. If the object is
a door, chest, or something like it, it will slam shut forcefully and
loudly. This spell can work on things that aren't portals (a sword could be
locked in its scabbard). You can also use this spell to lock a specific
memory or thought, making it immune to mind reading or scrying without a \RB
: \INT contest.  The duration is Markovian and depends on the number of
\DICE invested.  The Lock can be dispelled by the Knock spell if a Wizards'
Duel is lost.

You summon a giant slab of meat.  The meat has \SUMDICE+\DICE Health, and
can fill an area \DICE meters cubed.  The meat weighs \DICE x100kg and lasts
for \DICE Hours.  Zoological creatures will attack the Meat Shield first. 
Up to \DICE other creatures can eat the Meat Shield in lieu of rolling their
Provisions, but the provenance of the meat is ... unknown.  If a Scything
Disc of Nog is used on a Meat Shield, the shield will be dispelled if a

Your next inhalation allows you inhale 10x the normal amount of air. Not
only does this allow you to hold your breath for 10x as long, but if you
exhale forcefully it will release a blast of air strong enough to knock
pigeons out of air and polish your teeth. A human-sized creature is knocked
Prone and pushed Nearby unless they make a Contested roll using \DEX or \VIG
(their choice) with a -\DICE penalty.  This spell will also blow open all
the closed but unlocked doors in a room, shatter all the windows in a
building, or knock the thatched roof off a peasant's shack. If you cast this
spell with 3 or more \DICE, Save or your teeth shatter.

You create \DICE illusory images of yourself, which move as you move and
always stay Close to you. They are constantly stepping through each other,
so that it is impossible to tell which is which. When an enemy attacks you,
they'll always hit an image first.  An image vanishes as soon as it suffers
a solid impact (a blow from a mace, but also a slap). Area effects such as a
dragon's breath will cause all images to instantly vanish (and you take the
damage, naturally).

The ground \SUMDICE meters in radius and \DICE meters deep turns to black
muck.  Monsters and objects in the mud sink 1 meter a Moment.  At the top of
the Moment, a creature can make a Contested roll using \VIG with a -\DICE
penalty to pull themselves out 1 meter (if they were only 1 meter deep to
begin with, they escape).  If someone's head dips below the mud (2m for
people, 1m for Pooka, 4m or more for giants), they are immediately placed on
Death's Door, and have to roll their Death Die every turn they are under the
mud (they can still claw their way up 1m with a successful Contested roll,
as above).  If they don't have a Death Die, they die in \HD Moments.

The spell lasts for as long as you concentrate.  When you break your
concentration, everything that sunk in the mud is immediately thrown back to
the surface.   If the area covered by the Morass is targeted by Bastogne's
Glamping Charm, the Morass will be dispelled (and the objects brought to the
surface) if a Wizards' Duel is lost.

You roll a small orb of Mind to a point Close, Nearby or Far-Away; the orb
rolls silently and is hard to see.  When the orb stops rolling it
immediately and silently detonates.  Creatures Close to the designated point
are Deafened until they leave the area of effect.  Likewise, no spells can
be cast while Close to the Negasonic Bomb.  Skulking effects (including
Murder) succeed automatically while in range.  The spell lasts as long as
you concentrate.  The bomb can be dispelled by Cacaphony if a Wizards' Duel
is lost.

A brilliant white light emanates from your forehead to a point Nearby or

random Ally or Monster Close to the prism.  Roll a d8 on the table below for
each beam and apply its results.

\mynumlist {

  \item \mybold{Orange}  Target takes \DICE bashing damage, Save for half. 
  \item \mybold{Yellow} Target takes \DICE lightning damage, Save for half.  If you fail your Save, you drop what you're holding.

  \item \mybold{Blue} Target takes \DICE ice damage, Save for half. If you fail your Save, you fall Prone.
  \item \mybold{Indigo} Target takes \DICE stabbing damage, Save for half.
  \item \mybold{Violet} Target takes \DICE chopping damage, Save for half.
  \item \mybold{Roll} again.  Instead of \DICE damage, the effect deals \SUMDICE damage.. If you get this result again, the beam splits and the target takes an additional effect (roll again and apply the result).  Continue in this wayuntil you don't roll an 8.

You can breathe up to \DICE elements (fire, acid, water, wind, steam, etc)
immediately in front of you for a Moment.  The elements don't interact with
one another and act independently, so if you were to belch out fire and
water, you would get the effects of both.  If the order matters (set
something on fire and immediately douse it with water), you pick the order
of effects.  Water breath is enough to extinguish fires smaller than a big
bonfire, or wash off acid; wind breath could push a small sailboat or blow
swarming insects out of an area; acid breath bleaches the color from objects
and irritates the eyes; fire breath would cause paper and flammable objects
(but not people, unless they were doused in oil) to catch fire, etc.

Reduce all damage of a single chosen element (acid, cold, fire, lightning,
etc) by -\DICE.  The spell protects its targets from the negative effects of
the natural elements (desert heat, arctic chill) as well.  If you are struck

You send an invisible wedge of Force along the ground in a straight line up
to a Distant point.  The wedge can take up to \DICE turns ("left" or
"right") at your command.  Any light debris on the path (snow, small stones,
leaves, grass) is pushed to the side; fields can be tilled. Any pressure
plates or tripwires are activated. You do not have to be able to see the
entire path, but you do need to know the approximate route the wedge will
take. The wedge can't move through solid objects, and it can't hurt anyone.
The path cleared is \DICE meters wide. If you cast this spell with 3 \DICE
or more, the width becomes \SUMDICE meters wide.

You cough up a swirling spiral of sand.  Small flying creatures (bug-sized),

You become encased in elaborate plate mail that seems to be made from
constantly congealing blood.  You definitely stand out in a crowd. Your \MD
drops to d4, but you can still cast spells.  The \UD for the Armor depends
on the number of \DICE invested: 1 d3; 2 d4; 3 d6; 4 d8; 5 d10; 6+ d12.  If
you are struck with an Enervate spell, the Sanguine Mail is dispelled if a

Your clothes and hair animate to carry you around. You can move at full
speed in any orientation, and you can freely rotate as you move. For
instance, you could run while standing on your head, holding a torch, and
turning counterclockwise. You can lie on your side and, while flipping end
over end, move backwards. This effect does not allow you to climb up walls,
but ladders and ropes are no problem (you could suspend yourself from a rope
and cast spells, for example).  If you are struck with a Greaseball, or
attempt to climb something affected by Greaseball, the Scuttle is dispelled

You hurl a whirling disc of Force and light from your fingertip. The disc
screeches like a sawblade. It deals \SUMDICE damage to its target, Save for
half. If it deals more than 6 damage, it bounces towards a random creature
(friend, foe, or the Sorcerer herself) Close or Nearby, dealing \SUMDICE-2
damage, Save for half. If it deals more than 6 damage, it bounces towards
another random creature Close or Nearby, dealing \SUMDICE-4 damage, Save for
half. This continues, losing 2 damage with each bounce, until there are no
valid targets or the spell deals 6 or less damage to a creature.

You summon a cloud of somnomulent dust to a point Close or Nearby. 
\SUMDICE creatures Close to the cloud, who have no more than \DICE \HD, must
immediately Save or fall into a magical slumber.   They can't be awakened by
anything less than a vigorous slap (counts as a Maneuver).  You don't have
control over who falls asleep, it's entirely random and will be as many
creatures as possible (up to \SUMDICE).  You are immune to your own Sleep
spell (so you could cast it Close to yourself).  Creatures who fall asleep
immediately fall Prone and drop any items they're holding.  Fight rolls
agains them will hit automatically and do maximum damage, and can only be
blocked by Armor.  This will wake the creature up, of course.  If an orb of
Cacaphony is detonated Nearby, the creatures will awaken if a Wizards' Duel
is lost.  Otherwise, creatures who fall asleep will remain asleep for the
Markovian duration.

\SUMDICE dribbling candles appear on objects you touch. You can walk around
placing candles as required for Minutes. The candles are lit and burn for
Hours. They can be detached, but will fade from existence within Minutes. 
For every 6 candles placed Close to one another, the Sorcerer close to the
candles gains 1 of the following (your choice): Safe Casting: Replace one of
your rolled Blood Die with a natural 1; Power Casting: Replace one of your
rolled Blood Die with a natural 6; Natural Casting: add a natural +1 to any
Blood Die you've rolled.  When a Sorcerer uses 1 of these powers, the 6
candles immediately disappear.  Note that *any* Sorcerer can use these
abilities, friend or foe.  A Sorcerer will immediately know if they are in
an area of candles, and what powers it can bestow on them.  If the candles
are encased in a Fogbank, they are snuffed out and dispelled if a Wizards'
Duel is lost.

A tumult of air elementals lifts you and \DICE-1 others and takes you in any

elementals can only travel in a straight line, and you have to choose
beforehand the way to go ("up", "east", "that way", etc).  While you are in
the tempest you are buffeted horribly and can neither talk nor act.  The
winds refuse to travel without you, and will immediately dispel if you lose

You can cause up to \DICE Close, Nearby, Far-Away, or Distant creatures to

ground, across a hallway, etc).  Objects that touch the web immediately
become stuck; arrows and spears can't be fired through it.  Creatures that
enter the web (or are caught in it when cast) must Save or become ensnared
