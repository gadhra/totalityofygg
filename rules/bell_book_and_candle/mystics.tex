  And it has been said of old that all things that have been were wrought by the small gods, excepting only \TheAuthority, the Authority, the God of Having Done, who made the gods, and hath thereafter rested.  And none may pray to \TheAuthority but only to the gods whom he hath made.
}


\mysection{The Gift of Grace}{mystic-grace}

The Holy Word echoes and reverberates along the branches of Ygg.  The act of trying to understand the Word bestows the Authority's Grace on you.  Grace allows you to perform the \mylink{Seven Sacraments}{arcana-seven-sacraments}, found in the section on \mylink{Arcana}{arcana}

Grace Dice are \POOL, meaning if you roll a Failure (a 1 or a 2) you lose the die until you rest.  You can restore 1 Grace \POOL whenever you Bivouac. You can never use Grace to perform something that requires Faith. 

\mysection{The Crux of Mojo}{mystic-crux-mojo}

\flavor{
    Where's the game in life, behind the game behind the game... \Tilde Public Enemy
}

  While most Mortal connections to magic are driven by control and sacrifice, it is possible to wield magic by yielding to it.  Mojo allows you to tap into the wellspring of magic to protect yourself, harm your enemies, and command the dead.

  Your Mojo is represented as a \UD. You can use your Mojo \UD to power your Aura (see the description of this Virtue in the core rules) and to practice \mylink{Necromancy}{arcana-necromancy}. 

  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=.5]{Mystic_1}
  \end{center}


  \mysection{Cunning}{mystics-cunning}

  Cunning is used during a Vacation to perform the \mylink{Marvel of Occultism}{marvels-occultism}, and be used to help Spriggans practice \mylink{Sword Magic}{spriggan-sword-magic}.  Cunning is bound the the Wheel.


  \mysubsection{The Wheel}{mystics-the-wheel}

  Your Cunning moves counterclockwise through a Wheel of eight points - it ascends from the Void to Sickle, Quotidian, and Gibbous to Crown, then descends through Gibbous, Quotidian, and Sickle to return to the Void.
  
  During character creation, roll a d8 to see where your Mojo begins:

  \mytable{X X}{}
  {
    1 & Void \\
    2 & Waning Sickle \\
    3 & Waning Quotidian \\
    4 & Waning Gibbous \\
    5 & Waxing Sickle \\
    6 & Waxing Quotidian \\
    7 & Waxing Gibbous \\
    8 & Crown
  }

  Every Session, move your Mojo one step counter-clockwise along the wheel:

  For some powerful Marvels, you may need to move ”[num] Widdershins” before you can attempt the ritual again. A full Widdershins means you must make [num] transit(s) of the Wheel before you can cast the ritual again. 

    \begin{center}
  \includegraphics{mojo_circle}
  \end{center}

  For example, if you were at Crown, you must travel to Waning Gibbous, then Waning Quotidian, etc. all the way back around to Crown before you can try again (meaning you will need to play multiple Sessions). \\~  \\~

  \hrule




  Certain phases of the Wheel (as well as other members of your Coven and your familiar) provide additional Cunning:

  \mytable{X X}{}
  {
    Wheel: Crown & +3 \\
    Wheel: Gibbous & +2 \\
    Wheel: Wax Quotidian & +1 \\
    Coven & +1 each member \\
    Familiar: & +1 if present \\
  }  

  \cbreak

\mysection{The Crux of Faith}{mystic-crux-faith}

It is forbidden to worship \TheAuthority directly; instead, you whisper your prayers and invocations to the Small Gods, the Gods of Doing.  Your Faith (measured as d4 \UD) in your Small God allows you to invoke the Liturgies of the Authority they sit beneath.

Unlike Grace, Faith does not come back when you rest.  You can gain or regain Faith up to your \MAX by actively, aggressively pursing your Small God's influence on Acheron.  You gain Faith \UD completely at the Arbiter's discretion.  Some examples of things that might gain you Faith: slaughtering the priest of a rival cult; converting a crowd of listeners; invoking the name of your Small God and succeeding; eating hallucinogenic mushrooms and tripping balls while your Small God copulates with you, proclaiming your destiny, etc.

It's possible to lose Faith through your actions, as well.  When you do something your Small God doesn't approve of or witnesses something which would shake your belief: a commune of the converted found diseased deformed and starved, a call for help which goes unanswered, a nocturnal visit by a creeping hulking thing which whispers terrible secrets of the endless sky into the your ear heedless to the invocation of your God, you lose Faith Die.

If your Faith Die reach 0, you must immediately roll a d4 - on a Failure (a 1 or a 2) you suffer a \mylink{Crisis of Faith}{table-crisis-of-faith}; otherwise, gain +1 Faith \UD

\newpage

\mysubsection{The Contract}{mystics-the-contract}

The Small Gods must obey certain "rules" when dealing with Mortals:

\mynumlist {
  \item  The Small Gods must be true to their nature
  \item  The Small Gods must hear what Mortals have to say, and they must honor their bargains
  \item  The Small Gods can only hear a Mortal's words - they cannot hear their thoughts
  \item  The Small Gods must speak truth to Mortals about what is happening in distant places
  \item  The Small Gods must prophesy honestly - though they may try to trick Mortals with their words
}

\mysubsection{The Holy Symbol}{mystics-holy-symbol}

Your Holy Symbol allows you to harness your Faith to perform the \mylink{Liturgies}{mystics-liturgies}.  Tell the Arbiter what the Holy Symbol of your Small God is (there are a few ideas in the section on \mylink{Liturgies}{mystics-liturgies}).

A Holy Symbol is a \mylink{Holy Relic}{miracle-holy-relic}; you must perform the Miracle of \mylink{Holy Relic}{miracle-holy-relic} to create a new one if yours is lost or destroyed.  Remember that your Holy Symbol contains a single Faith die that you can use in a pinch.  If you use this Faith Die and roll a Failure, the Faith Die is lost and the Holy Symbol becomes a normal item (and can't be used to perform \mylink{Liturgies}{mystics-liturgies} anymore).

You don't need a Holy Symbol to practice the \mylink{The Seven Sacraments}{arcana-seven-sacraments}


\mysubsection{Divine Favor}{mystics-divine-favor}

You may call upon your Small God to directly intercede on your behalf.  To do this, you must roll \mybold{all} of your Faith dice, the \SUMDICE of the roll must be 60 or better.

The divine favor must be something your Small God would have some control over, based on their aspect (Arbiter's discretion).  For example, Vulcan (Small God of fires, volcanoes, and the forge, who sits beneath the Civilized Authority) might not be able to affect the curse of the Ice Queen.  

The Small Gods cannot violate the basic laws of the Authority:

  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=.5]{Mystic_2}
  \end{center}

\mybullet {
  \item Matter and energy can neither be created nor destroyed, as this is the demense of \TheAuthority; they can only be transformed or changed from one form to another.  Once a spirit has departed for the Isle of the Dead, it is beyond the reach of the Small Gods forever. 

  \item Entropy always increases.  Time cannot flow backward; sword strikes cannot heal; you cannot "fall" against the direction of gravity. It is possible to suspend this Law (to roll back time, for instance), but only for a few Moments before it reverts to entropy again.

  \item A \myital{noumenon} cannot be removed by a Small God. A Small God cannot directly slay something on the Mortal plane.

  \item All matter and energy has a destiny in the dream of \TheAuthority.  A Small God cannot cause matter or energy to do something that violates this destiny, and the ultimate destiny is only known to the Authority. (Practically, this means the effects of a Divine Favor are up to the Arbiter's discretion in the end!)

}

\cbreak

The Small God may also demand a sacrifice of some kind, or expect payment later ...


\example {
  \mylist {
    \item Time rolls back for a few seconds to stop a killing blow from falling, or to reroll a missed Save.

    \item A powerful magical item or artifact needs to be sundered

    \item A sea must be parted, a tunnel opened through a mountain, or a boulder pushed to seal an entrance

    \item Stones and trees, or sand and ice, assemble themselves into a fortress to protect the faithful
  }
}

\mysubsection{The Authorities}{mystics-authorities}

The Small Gods sit in uncountable multitudes beneath the ten Authorities (though there are said to be 13 in all, 3 hidden from the eyes of Mortals). Your personal Faith in a Small God allows you to invoke the Liturgies of the Authority they sit beneath. Each Authority has four core \mylink{Liturgies}{mystics-liturgies} that the faithful can practice: the Liturgy of the Novitiates, the Liturgy of the Clerics, the Liturgy of the Apostles, and the Liturgy of the Saints.  During your adventures, you may also find Liturgies of your Small God etched on bronze tablets hidden by fearful priests in stinking swamps, forgotten in reliquaries lying in pawn shops, or written in the slime of snails tripping balls on shrooms.

The more esoteric scholars further divide the Authorities into "left hand" and "right hand", placing them in opposition at the feet of \TheAuthority.  This is the realm of zealots and sectarians: those who swear eternal vengeance on the Authority that sits across from them.

\mybold{The Major Divinities}

The four empires of Acheron recognize the following Small Gods as major divinities.  You will find shrines, temples, and churches dedicated to these Small Gods in every major city and port.  These 70 Small Gods represent a small fraction of the thousands of Small Gods worshipped across the face of Acheron.

The interior of the pyramid is Hallowed ground, and can safely house yourself and up to 12 other Allies. Spectral footmen flit around a banquet table groaning beneath ample food and drink  (no need for anyone to roll Provisions) - anyone who eats from this table heals full Grit and never get drunk.  Warm and comfortable beds lie behind privacy screens; anyone who chooses to rest regains full Flesh. Nothing can enter the pyramid without your permission, save for extraordinarily powerful beings (Arbiter's discretion).  The pyramid will last until the Bivouac ends; the stones and spectres disappear as if they had never been.

    \item \mybold{Timestop:}  Once per Session, you can stop time for a Moment.  You can do this at any time - just before a killing blow falls, or just as a Philosopher is about to release a spell.  You may then immediately take action.  In Combat, you may take two Actions as normal as if this were a "normal" Moment.  Combat Actions automatically succeed (including Fight rolls), though the rule about a Fight action ending the Moment still applies.
    \item  Choose two Mysteries from this Authority or from your Small God (if applicable).  You may perform those Mysteries using your Faith.

    \item When attacking with a Brawl weapon, you deal +1 damage
    \item \mybold{Rending Strike:} Any weapon in your hands has the Rend attribute (see the Core Rules for details)

\mybullet {
    \item When attacking with a Brawl weapon, you deal +3 damage instead of +1.
    \item \mybold{Shattering Strike:} In Combat, instead of attacking a person, you can attack their weapon instead.  If you successfully hit, the Monster must \RB : \VIG against your \FOC.  If they fail, the weapon is destroyed.  Magic weapons get a +4 to their rolls.
    \item Choose two Mysteries from this Authority or from your Small God (if applicable).  You may perform those Mysteries using your Faith.

\mybold{\myanchor{Liturgy of the Apostles}{ruinous-liturgy-apostles}}

\mybullet {
    \item When attacking with a Brawl weapon, you add +\LVL damage instead of +3.
    \item \mybold{Rotting Touch:} You can putrefy food and drink with a touch.  The amount you can putrefy depends on how long you touch the object - an apple might rot in Moments, but a well will take Hours to contaminate (Arbiter's discretion).  Anyone eating the food or water is afflicted with a Silver (d8) Toxin.
    \item Choose two Mysteries from this Authority or from your Small God (if applicable).  You may perform those Mysteries using your Faith.
