%%% STAFF MAGIC
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\mysection{Staff Magic}{sorcerer-staff-magic}

A magical staff is a necessity for a Sorcerer to control more complex wizardry and mysteries.  A staff must be made out of a special material that should be worked out between you and the Arbiter.  The more powerful the staff, the better the material must be.  If you're making a low level staff you might need a branch from an ash tree from the Forbidden Wood.  If you're making a high level staff, it might need to be the femur of the Great Wyrm Vermithrax.  

All staffs are 2-handed Fast Brawl weapons that do d6 damage; can produce light at will (as a Torch); can hit creatures only affected by magic weapons; and can dispel \mylink{Illusion}{wizardry-illusion} with a touch (though this will  prompt a \mylink{Wizards' Duel}{sorcerer-wizards-duel} if the opposing Sorcerer is present).

The staff must have a \mylink{Wizard Sigil}{sigil-wizard} inscribed upon it, at which point the staff is bound to the Sorcerer. The staff in the hands of anyone else is just a normal quarterstaff (though obviously the staff will be of special material that can be made into a new staff). 

A Staff is limited to 3 powers, but you can "mix and match" from any group as you wish (so the staff could have 2 Iron powers and 1 Gold power if you wanted). These are just the most common abilities; you're encouraged to work out additional abilities with the Arbiter.

The second column of each table indicates if the ability can be bought more than once.  When you see \mybold{[num]} in a description, this is the number of times you bought the ability.

\flavor{
  As the green flames, stung by her runes, leaped up, and the heat of the fire grew intenser, she stepped backwards further and further, and merely uttered her runes a little louder the further she got from the fire. She bade Alveric pile on logs, dark logs of oak that lay there cumbering the heath; and at once, as he dropped them on, the heat licked them up; and the witch went on pronouncing her louder runes, and the flames danced wild and green; and down in the embers the seventeen, whose paths had once crossed Earth's when they wandered free, knew heat again as great as they had known, even on that desperate ride that had brought them here. And when Alveric could no longer come near the fire, and the witch was some yards from it shouting her runes, the magical flames burned all the ashes away and that portent that flared on the hill as suddenly ceased, leaving only a circle that sullenly glowed on the ground, like the evil pool that glares where thermite has burst. And flat in the glow, all liquid still, lay the sword. \Tilde The King of Elfland's Daughter
}



The Rom who have turned their backs on Elfland still have some skill in writing the runes and glyphs of the Abandoned onto Mortal weapons: longswords, shortswords, daggers, and spears. 

\mysubsection{Magic Weapons}{spriggan-magic-weapons}

Enchanted weapons can all strike creatures that require magical weapons to hit, and can emit a small circle of bluish or greenish light at will (similar to the light cast by a few candles).

Weapons are often named after their wielder or maker, and the powers of the runes on the blade.  Some examples:

\mybullet {
  \item The Hallowed and Indestructible Spear of Yoon-Suin
  \item The Thrice Deadly Dagger of Kos
  \item The Flaming and Twice Accurate Sword of Magnuss
}

\mysubsection{The Runes of Elfland}{spriggan-elfland-runes}

\mylist {

  \item Because Spriggan cannot handle iron, the material of the weapon must be exotic (silver, gold, etc) or otherworldly (adamantium, meteorite).  The material needs to be available and should be worked out with the Arbiter.  Only daggers, swords (long and short), and spears can be enchanted

  \item In order to accept an enchantment, the weapon must have a Mortal sigil, mark, or writ etched onto the blade, once for each Elfland Rune.  Archaic runes require a \mylink{Wizard Sigil}{sigil-wizard}, Fiendish runes require a \mylink{Witch Mark}{occultism-witch-mark}, and Seraphic runes require a \mylink{Holy Writ}{miracle-holy-writ}.

  \item The weapons is enchanted with the help of the Abandoned.  You must use 4 Remembrance Die to summon one of the Abandoned whose True Name you know.  Each Abandoned can write a single Elfland Rune on the weapon.  The Abandoned can only write in the language that they know:  Archons can only write Archaic Runes, Fiends can only write Fiendish Runes, and Seraphs can only write Seraphic Runes.

  \item  Aside from the cost of the weapon itself, you must pay for the materials necessary to perform the magic.  The 
  The first Rune costs 5,000\FE in materials.  The second Rune costs 5,000\AG in materials.  The third (or more) Rune(s) cost 5,000\AU in materials.
