value[]="Sleek clinging moist drapery."
value[]="Esoteric symbology tattooed in black around their jawline and up to their lower lip, a solid black circle on their throat."
value[]="The whites of their eyes dyed a startling shade of violet, skin vigilantly powdered deathly pale."
value[]="Neck and throat painted bronze, stopping severely at the jawline."
value[]="Eyelids are painted metallic black and bear an inverted white triangle."
value[]="Sleek muscled limbs and a belly hanging in cellulite neglect. It's almost impressive in its absurdity."
value[]="A stubby off-white candle attached to the back of their hand by a mess of melted wax, lit at times appointed by their inscrutable religion."
value[]="An elaborate plaster chest-piece hanging from their neck, baroque floral sculpting like a painting's frame."
value[]="Ritual scarification of a flower opening in the centre of their chest."
value[]="Left arm dyed blue with the distilled pigment of the crushed petals of the lotus."
value[]="Bottom lip split in the middle and cauterised to leave an ever-drooling gully of perfect pink flesh."
value[]="Eyelid removed from right eye, carrying a small glass jar of water with a brush attached to the lid to moisten their exposed eyeball."
value[]="A small orange bird attached to their left shoulder by a golden chain, singing coded messages to each other."
value[]="Oil of vitriol burned into the nape of their neck in a perfect bare hand print, fuck knows who did it, the hand prints are all the same."
value[]="They all have a stocky little black dog strapped to their chest, like a baby harness, it hangs there with its legs sticking out, limp paws hanging, staring at you through a porcelain doll mask, a low humming growl resonating from its ribcage."
value[]="Hands dip-died red past the wrist, nails tapered and lacquered black, copious amounts of white fabric."
value[]="Golden needles like quills bristling from the back of their necks."
value[]="A large sickly green poison dart frog, crawling over their face, attached to a delicate brass chain threaded between their ears, forehead, and nose by a circlet around its foot."
value[]="Fields of tiny oil-black mushrooms grow from the inner sides of their arms, constantly held slightly aloft from their body so as not to damage them, looking eery as fuck."
value[]="A thousand pearl-drop spiders, trying to cocoon them, repairing tears as they walk."
value[]="The lengthy feathers of one hundred birds plucked during their mating dance, splayed out in absurd plumes of colour from all the best parts."
value[]="A hanging gorget of lorica plumata, flimsy golden scales dangling over the naked breast, filmy silk underwear covering their modesty, leggings and loose sleeves sewn from the hides of Dividing Leopard Worms, venom milked from the (majority of the) defensive hairs for safety."
value[]="A brass monkey cage strapped to their back, extending above their head, anchored by an elaborately embroidered corset. The monkey has honey-coloured fur and void-black eyes, shrieking at you with a crimson void of a mouth. Monkey spit and shit stains their shoulders and they seem not to care."
value[]="Overlapping copper plates like a flower blooming up around their chest, face powdered with dabs of orange spices like an explosive spray of pollen."
value[]="An intricate set of leg armour carved from dark wood, with shingled shins and sickeningly colourful fungus growing from the backs of their thighs, bobbing fruiting bodies dusting spores in their wake as they walk."
value[]="Constrictive bands of silver polished to blinding, prickling with long randomly jutting spikes that necessitate dramatically raised arms and tiptoeing in a constant pose of ballet absurdity."
value[]="A floor-length black loincloth and naked skin dripped with malleable lava flows of resinous wax, the shimmering carapaces of entombed beetles and spiders visible through the translucent surface like veins of amber"
value[]="Deep purple robes open to expose flashes of naked skin, their oversized length smeared with muck and trailing silver chains leashed to a trio of albino monkeys with crimson  script dyed in bands around their fur."
value[]="An eight-arch crown covered in vivid living fungus, probably crawling with insects, body draped in an apron of gold-dusted hanging lichen."
value[]="Prodigious weight held within a beaten copper plackart, absurdly round, plates of powdered breast jutting over its girth like balconies of naked flesh. Severely tapered legs sprout from the glittering ball covered in gauzy white ruched fabric, laced at intervals to form tiers of billowing pouches."
value[]="Night-dark fabric stitched together with exposed golden thread, weeping purple fruits impaled upon a collar of iron spikes extending above their head in a storm cloud of buzzing insects."
value[]="Half mask of horns, horns on the eyes horns on the temples horns horns horns. Lips painted lifeblood red and limbs wrapped all about with rich red velvet string, pale flesh bulging between the lines."
value[]="All puffed pantaloons and slashed sleeves, ruffled and pouchy in fabrics cut and dyed in resemblance of a cacophonous bouquet, a placid black bone china mask obscuring their face."
value[]="Ochre-painted naked skin but for a collar bearing five vertical spikes that support a black veil draped over their head."
value[]="The remains of two boars sewn into a kind of shawl, their rearing heads mounted on the shoulders, grotesque open tusked maws like screaming epaulettes, the outer foreleg of each sewn into a sleeve, their spines joining together, fused with thread, tails dangling salaciously about the wearer's glittering posterior, bedecked in a gown of clingy gold chainmail."
value[]="An elaborately decorated bustle sprouting from their hips, overlapping organic spiralled layers of silk making it look like an absurd voluptuous cocoon. And it is, carefully chosen so as to hatch a swarm of butterflies at the perfect moment of the night for maximum visual effect."
value[]="A big boofy bell-skirted dress made entirely of glass, it has to be lowered over her head by a team of sweating steady-handed attendants. The refraction of the angled glass means you never really get a good look at her tits, the moment you think you see a nipple it jumps six inches to the left."
value[]="Luscious bunched wrappings of fabric in violet hues around their legs and hips, framing a ceramic paunch of a belly plate, bone white and hanging over their groin, full of holes like a pot belly hive."
value[]="They kneel upon a small podium carried on the backs of two long-haired goats, wearing a girdle of hair that obscures their legs and tumbles down the goat's sides, fusing them together. Gold-dipped goat hooves line the lower back of their tight-stitched black leather bodysuit, each successive row showing more trembling leg up to their shoulder blades. They pout red lips and ring sulky bells hanging from the goat's curved horns as they pass you by."
