\myital{These are pretty much verbatim from Logan Knight's delightful \href{https://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/does-this-look-infected/}{Does This Look Infected?}}

If you don't have a Mystic in your party who can feed your Curse to a Hekaphage, then you'll have to make do with cursebreakers, witchfinders, and cunning folk.  The cost is 100 coins and a roll on the table below (feel free to improvise, too!)

  \mytable{l X} {

    1 &  While breathing in the fragrant smoke of burning Govora pollen, ingest a pint of pig urine to induce vomiting. Drown a nightingale in the spilled contents of your stomach within the waiting iron urn, then keep the drowned body beneath your bed for three days before throwing it out the East window \\
    2 &  A pregnant rat, teeth pulled and pups moving beneath fat-smeared fur, must be swallowed alive. When it gives birth to its young the affliction will pass onto them before they die and pass through your digestion.\\
    3 &  Your face must be smothered with a duck-down pillow soaked in vinegar and hyena urine. When you finally struggle for breath at the point of collapse the pillow will be removed so that you may be slapped full in the face with a stillborn hound. This will be repeated as many times as necessary. \\
    4 &  Hold six blessed sparrow eggs in your mouth and descend into the Corpusmilch Canal, do not swallow them until you touch the bottom.\\
    5 &  Your body will be smeared with the putrescent black mud of the Nameless Bog. Ingest a small amount, be cautious not to consume too much, and do not bathe until two days have passed.\\
    6 &  Submerge yourself in a copper bath of goat's milk while suckling at the teat of a wetnurse until the malady has passed.\\
    7 &  Swallow a river stone wrapped in maiden's hair. The hair will absorb the affliction and pass from you along with the stone. \\
    8 &  The affliction must be drawn out through the skin. Cupping using the severed horns of a tribe of black goats sacrificed beneath the full moon. \\
    9 &  The afflicted area must be wrapped in dried kelp that was once soaked in the urine of an unfaithful man. The smoldering ashes of a sapling will then be laid upon it until they have burnt through and touched flesh. \\
    10 & Inhale a pinch of blue moss from the silver-gilded goat's head snuff mull and seek the Divine Polycerate Goat in your dream wanderings. Supplicate before him and he may gnaw the affliction from your being. \\
    11 & A candle made from the fat of a drowned man and scented with Spring's first bloom must be sat upon the forehead and allowed to burn down to hard streams of yellow nothing \\
    12 & You must lie within a circle of blessed yellowed candles, with the ashy pollen of the Widow's Blossom dusted upon your face. Throughout the night the affliction will call to you from beyond the waxen circle in voices myriad and sweet. If you resist their call until morning, it will pass. \\
