The oddities below can only be created by using Research.  Research can only be used during a Vacation.  More notes on Research can be found in the Core Rules.  

Research has 3 crafts associated with it:


\mytable{X X X} {
    \thead{Craft} & \thead{Research} & \thead{Cost in Coins} \\
} {
    Iron & 1 & 100\FE \\
    Silver & 3 & 300\AG \\
    Gold & 5 & 500\AU
}

The "Cost" is a generic amount to reflect the materials needed to manifest the fruits of your Research - special books, alembics, inks, quills, etc.   The amount paid counts towards your Glory.
