\mysection{Staff Magic}{wonder-staff-magic}

A staff can be a cane, club, wand, staff, caduceus, or walking stick; it is a necessary accessory for any Philosopher reaching the heights of their study. It must be made out of a special material: the more powerful the staff, the better the material must be.  If you're making an Iron level staff you might need a branch from an ash tree from the Forbidden Wood.  If you're making a Gold level staff, it might need to be the femur of the Great Wyrm Vermithrax.  Work this out with the Arbiter!

All staffs are 2-handed Fast Brawl weapons that do d6 damage.  They can produce light at will (as a torch); can hit creatures only affected by magic weapons; and can dispel \mylink{Illusion}{wizardry-illusion} with a touch (though this will prompt a \mylink{Wizards' Duel}{philosopher-wizards-duel} if the opposing wizard is present).

If you do not wish anyone else to use this staff, it can be bound with a \mylink{Wizard Sigil}{research-sigil-wizard} created by you. As long as the staff has your Wizard Sigil on it, the staff is just a normal quarterstaff in anyone else's hands (though obviously made of special material!).  You must place the Wizard Sigil at the moment you create the staff.

A Staff is limited to 3 powers, but you can "mix and match" from any group as you wish (so the staff could have 2 Iron powers and 1 Gold power if you wanted). These are just the most common abilities; you're encouraged to work out additional abilities with the Arbiter.

The "Stackable" column in the table indicates if the ability can be bought more than once.  When you see \NUM in a description, this is the number of times you bought the ability.
