Medicinals allow you to heal the more permanent ailments that might be afflicting the other members of your Band.   To practice your craft, the Settlement where you're taking the Vacation must have a Sanitarium and/or Library present (see the Core Rules).  Medicinals require no coin, but you can make a donation to the Sanitarium or Library if you'd like (up 200 coins of the appropriate type per Research spent) in order to convert coin to Glory.
