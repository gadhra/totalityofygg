  Other folk? Not smart like we are (maybe Pooka, not sure).  They dumb, just pretend they know.  Only we know truth - Life and Chaos are same-same.  And no one talk to Chaos the way \myital{we} do. Humans say that make us bad. "One hole owed" they say.  But we owe nothing! Plus you can't owe a hole. Hole not there! See how dumb they are? Only real way talk to Chaos is be Chaos.  Chaos all around, like ocean. Folks build boats.  We swim.  That make us strong. That make us wise.

People you meet assume you're the one in charge, simple folk bow before you, you are greeted with at worst grudging respect and at best adoration wherever you go (save by certain sects and cults who abhor the Unhallowed).
        \item 2nd time: Your beard becomes a legend.  Referring to your beard becomes a linguistic emphasis:  "I will be avenged, by the beard of Fex!" or "Stump's goatee, that's ugly!" You can wrap yourself in your magnificent beard in lieu of clothing - treat as Heavy Armor with no \MD penalty.

		\item  1st time: You're generally ... sticky.  Like the adhesive on the back of a sticky note.  You could stick papers to yourself, and you won't lose your grip if you're climbing a rope or ladder
        \item  2nd time: You're now as sticky as tar.  You won't drop things that you're holding (you can't be disarmed).  You could stick a weapon to your body.  You can turn this stickiness "off" at will.
        \item  3rd time: You're now as sticky as sovereign glue.  You can't drop things you're holding unless you will it.  You can climb up a wall like a spider and hang from the ceiling like a fly (though you'd need to be naked).
        \item  4th time: Roll again
	}

\mybold{Tough'un}
	\mylist {
		\item 1st time: \myital{He was like a saddlebag with eyes!}  You look (and are) very tough.  You get a +2 to any rolls where you're trying to intimidate someone.  You don't take any damage from effects of mundane weather (snow, rain, sand, etc)
        \item 2nd time: As above, plus you add +4 to any \DEATH rolls
        \item 3rd time: As above, plus you gain +10 Flesh
        \item 4th time: Roll again
	}
\mybold{Tusky}
	\mylist {
		\item 1st time:  You grow a pair of small tusks.  The tusks act as if you're wearing a helmet.  If you should sunder them, they'll grow back after you take a Vacation.
        \item 2nd time:  As above, but your tusks are much bigger.  If you execute the \mylink{Bum Rush}{combat-deeds-bum-rush}, you can strike with your tusks as a Combat Action.  The tusks are Hard Brawl weapons that deal d6 damage.
        \item 3rd time:  As above, but your tusks are huge.  You like to decorate them with bands of iron and rings.  Your tusks are treated as Hard Brawl weapons that do d12 damage in a \mylink{Bum Rush}{combat-deeds-bum-rush}
        \item 4th time:  Roll again
	}


  \mysubsection{Gear}{night-children-virtues-gear}


\mybold{Bedlam Bag}
	\mylist {
		\item When you open the bag and turn it upside down, roll a d4 to see what falls out:  (1) a few thousand ball bearings; (2) a bomb with a countdown timer.  The bomb will explode at the bottom of the \mybold{next} Moment.  There's a 50/50 chance it's a dud (the Arbiter will roll in secret), but will deal 8d6 damage to everyone Close to it if it explodes (Save vs Doom for half damage).  The bomb can be thrown;  (3) a half dozen gremlins fall out and run in different directions, immediately causing as many problems as possible for Minutes; (d)  Bats. A lot.
	}




\mybold{Big Helm}
	\mylist {
		\item A giant helmet.  The helmet will protect you from being \mylink{Dazed}{gear-weapon-daze} and from certain Wounds and Beatings.  In addition, if a Monster's attack is about to cause you \mybold{physical} damage, you may immediately take a Combat Action to destroy the helmet, taking no damage.  The helmet is "fixed" at the start of next Session.
	}
\mybold{Big Pal}
	\mylist {
		\item Your big pal is .5m taller than you, looks extremely intimidating, and is very sensitive.  Big pal's feelings get hurt easily.  Big pal can carry you around and boost you up for hard to reach places.  In Combat, Big Pal likes to watch from the back and shout encouragement; however, if you are ever injured in Combat, your Big Pal will immediately join the fight.  Big Pal has 6 Flesh and gives you +4 to your Fight \RO.  You can put any damage you would normally take on Big Pal instead.  If Big Pal should die, another Big Pal shows up at the start of the next Session.
	}

\mybold{Big Shield}
	\mylist {
		\item A giant shield.  The shield should be treated as an additional suit of Light Armor (d4 \UD); however it takes 2 hands to use.  The shield is repaired the same way Armor is.
	}
\mybold{Bogeylatch}
	\mylist {
		\item  Once per Session, you can attach this doorknob to a hard surface and open a door 2m high, 1m wide, and .5m thick.  The door exists until someone closes it; the bogeylatch appears back in your pocket.
	}

\mybold{Bug Pal}
	\mylist {
		\item  You can ride it. If it dies, you find a new bug pal at the start of next Session.  Edible.
	}
\mybold{Devil Pen}
	\mylist {
		\item  Contracts signed with this pen (in blood) between two willing parties are magically enforced. Breaking the contract means the responsible party suffers a permanent Greater Curse which can only be removed by the other party in the contract.
	}
\mybold{Fly Rug}
	\mylist {
		\item  You and up to 4 allies can "ride" this flying carpet.  The rug can levitate up and down and can move forwards and backwards at a slow pace (about walking speed).  The Fly Rug has no handles, so be careful you don't get knocked off.
	}


\mybold{Gobbomb}
	\mylist {
		\item \myital{Anytime I had a problem and I threw a Molotov cocktail, boom! Right away, I had a different problem}  At the start of the Session, you create 3 explosive grenades.  These are Fast Throw weapons that deal 3d6 damage to everything Close to their point of explosion (Save vs Doom for half damage).  Throwing a grenade is a Combat Action.  The grenades will also set flammable things on fire.  Every grenade has a 1-in-4 chance of being a dud (rolled in secret by the Arbiter).  If you don't use the grenades by the end of the Session, they're all duds.
	}
\mybold{Gobsword}
	\mylist {
		\item You gain a weapon appropriate for your species: a pair of Norn scissors, a giant tooth through a club, the mandible of a predatory insect - tell the Arbiter what it is.  The weapon is a Fast Brawl weapon that does d8 damage and is magic.
	}
\mybold{Gremlin Tools}
	\mylist {
		\item  Once per Session, you can use the Gremlin tools to do one of the following:  (a) remove a Trivial or Minor Sigil; (b) "repair" 4 points of Flesh damage (not pretty); (c) repair a suit of Armor to its \MAX \UD; (d) "fix" something that's broken (Arbiter's discretion)
	}
\mybold{Hole}
	\mylist {
		\item  It's a hole you can fold up like a handkerchief.  The hole can be laid flat on any surface, but it has to stick there (so you'll have to get creative if you want to hang it from the wall or ceiling).  The hole is 500 cm wide but 3m deep.  Anything you put in here is considered to be in \mylink{Hammerspace}{keyword-hammerspace}  
	}
\mybold{Kazoo}
	\mylist {
		\item  Once per Session, you can put on a little kazoo concert.  Pick 1:  (a) purge a Mental or Spiritual Wound from someone; (b) during a Breather, bring everyone to full Grit; (c) end all Markovian effects Close to you; (d) restore 1 point of Flesh to everyone Close to you (friend or foe).  If you actually play the kazoo, pick 2.
	}



\mybold{Kissy Lips}
	\mylist {
		\item  A tube of very bright coral lipstick.  Once per Session, you can apply this lipstick and do one of the following:  (a) tell everyone about the interesting things in a room you're in, even if hidden from view ("there's a secret door in the north wall, a magic dagger hidden in the chimney, and a spider waiting to ambush us in the corner."); (b) tell effortless and undetectable lies for d6 Minutes;  (c) Charm everyone Close to you with a risqué performance (Save vs Doom or Charmed for as long as you perform); (d) whistle a tune that removes all Markovian effects on Allies Close or Nearby.
	}


\mybold{Little Buddy}
	\mylist {
		\item  A little kobold buddy. He can't do much except hold a light source.  Unquestionably loyal and extraordinarily stupid.  If he dies, you find a new friend the next day.  Edible.
	}
\mybold{Magic Beans}
	\mylist {
		\item At any time, you can water your Magic Beans and grow them.  Roll a d24 on this table; that piece of Gear grows from the Magic Beans.  If you roll a piece of Gear you already have - too bad, nothing happens.
	}
\mybold{Mirror Mirror}
	\mylist {
		\item Once per Session, you can reach into the Mirror Mirror and pull out a copy of an object reflected in the mirror.  The object that you pull out must be within reach of the mirror (as if it were a window), small enough to fit through the mirror (as if it were a window) and can’t weigh
more than 10kg. The mirror object looks and feels exactly like the object it copied, though it is a mirror image (so if you were to copy a book, the text would be backwards). You can’t copy any magical properties of the object, and you can only duplicate objects, not living things. The object exists for Minutes. If the object suffers a solid blow, it pops like a bubble.
	}

\mybold{Packpack}
	\mylist {
		\item  Giant, colossal backpack that only you can wear.  You can reach into this backpack and produce any mundane item (at the Arbiter's final discretion).  The object can't be valuable in and of itself (no pulling out gems or jewels) and has to be smaller than a human arm (daggers and short swords OK, polearms not so much).  Additionally, you can store 25 Significant Items in the backpack as if they were in \mylink{Hammerspace}{keyword-hammerspace}.  The backpack doesn't affect your \MD in any way. 
	}

\mybold{Red Shoes}
	\mylist {
		\item  Once per Session, you can click the heels of your Red Shoes together to undo \mybold{any} die roll that hits the table.  The person who rolled immediately re-rolls.  You have to have feet to use the Red Shoes.
	}
\mybold{Skelly Key}
	\mylist {
		\item Once per Session, you can open any mundane locked thing.  
	}

\cbreak

\mybold{Spinny Wheel}
	\mylist {
		\item  Once per Session, you can use the Spinny Wheel when taking a \mylink{Bivouac}{combat-resting-bivouac} to produce one of the following: (a) 10 gold coins (doesn't count for XP).  Requires straw; (b) a single dose of any Iron or Silver Toxin or Sera.  The dose is delivered through the spindle; (c) an unraveling spool of thread that shows you the most direct way out of where you are; (d) a story that enchants all of your Allies, granting +6 Grit (even above their \MAX)
	}
\mybold{The Crew}
	\mylist {
		\item  A crew of goblins, kobolds, orcs, and other unsavories follows you around (d4+2 to start).  Every 2 members of the Crew (rounded down) grant you +1 to all \RO and \RS attempts.  Each Crew member requires a Provision roll when taking a \mylink{Bivouac}{combat-resting-bivouac} (though they are cannibalistic so there's some cost cutting opportunities).  They are loyal, loud, and extraordinarily stupid.  Sneaking up on people is out.  Your crew is always between 2 and 10 members.  If you ever get to 0 crew members, 2 crew members show up next Session - otherwise, you gain 1 crew member each Session, up to 10 crew.
	}



\mybold{Trunk Pal}
	\mylist {
		\item A small bureau that follows you around on hundreds of tiny feet.  Surprisingly fast.  Can store up to 25 Significant Items for you and obey simple commands.  Will "give" you an item stored in it at your immediate request. If it gets destroyed, you find it leaning over you when you wake up next Session - but there's a 50/50 chance each Significant Item in it doesn't make it back (roll for each)
	}
\mybold{Vorpal Sword}
	\mylist {
		\item  A beautiful jewel encrusted sword of extraordinary sharpness.  The Vorpal Sword is a Hard Brawl weapon that deals d8 damage and is magic.  The damage die explodes.  If you ever do 20+ points of damage with the sword, the victim is decapitated unless they make a Save vs Doom.
	}

	}
\mybold{Bad Mouth}
	\mylist {
		\item   No one can understand your accent until they've deal with you for awhile.  You're Allies understand you, but no one else does.
	}
\mybold{Bumpback}
	\mylist {
		\item   Doesn't affect your movement or anything, but everyone always assumes you're the party's assistant / torch-bearer / etc.  You don't get much respect.
	}
\mybold{Dirty}
	\mylist {
		\item  You can't own nice things.  Clothing you wear becomes almost instantly soiled, weapons rusty, armor squeaky.  It doesn't have any mechanical effect, but you're not permitted in polite society
	}
