  \example {
    \mybold{Knowledge Die} + Modifiers vs. Target
  }


    The art of Leechcraft allows you to practice \mybold{Remedies} by rolling your Knowledge Die vs. a Target (see below).  Unless otherwise noted, Leechcraft requires 2 Actions to perform.  The recipient of the Leechcraft \mybold{cannot move} while you are applying your medicines.  Your \INT adds a bonus to your roll:

    \mytable{X r}{
      \thead{\INT} & \thead{Bonus} \\
    }{
      d2-d10 & +0  \\
      d12 & +1  \\
      d16 & +2  \\
      d20 & +3  \\
      d24 & +4 \\
    }
   
  If you roll less than the Target number, your next roll is at -2.  This is cumulative:  -2 for the first miss, -4 for the second, etc.  These negatives are removed when you take a \mylink{Bivouac}{combat-resting-bivouac}. When rolling, your \SUMDICE can never be less than 1.
