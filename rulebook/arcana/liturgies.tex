\mysection{Liturgies}{arcana-liturgies}

The core Liturgies of the Ten Authorities can be found below.  Your personal Faith in a Small God allows you to invoke the Liturgies of the Authority they sit beneath. During your adventures, you may also find Liturgies of your Small God etched on bronze tablets hidden by fearful priests in stinking swamps, forgotten in reliquaries lying in pawn shops, or written in the slime of snails tripping balls on shrooms (Liturgies of your Small God depend completely on the Arbiter)

\mybold{Liturgies require a Holy Symbol to perform}.  If you don't have your Holy Symbol, you get none of the benefits of a Liturgy, and you can't invoke any of the powers beneath it.




\mysubsection{The Contract}{liturgies-the-contract}

The Small Gods must obey certain "rules" when dealing with Mortals:

\mynumlist {
  \item  The Small Gods must be true to their nature
  \item  The Small Gods must hear what Mortals have to say, and they must honor their bargains
  \item  The Small Gods can only hear a Mortal's words - they cannot hear their thoughts
  \item  The Small Gods must speak truth to Mortals about what is happening in distant places
  \item  The Small Gods must prophesy honestly - though they may try to trick Mortals with their words
}

\mysubsection{The Holy Symbol}{liturgies-holy-symbol}

Your Holy Symbol allows you to harness your Faith to perform the Liturgies of your Small God.  Tell the Arbiter what the Holy Symbol of your Small God is (there are some ideas under the section on \mylink{Authorities}{mystics-authorities} below)

A Holy Symbol is a \mylink{Holy Relic}{miracle-holy-relic}; you must perform the Miracle of \mylink{Holy Relic}{miracle-holy-relic} to create a new one if yours is lost or destroyed.  Remember that your Holy Symbol contains a single Faith die that you can use in a pinch.  If you use this Faith Die and roll a Failure, the Faith Die is lost and the Holy Symbol becomes a normal item (and can't be used to perform Liturgies)

You don't need a Holy Symbol to practice the \mylink{The Seven Sacraments}{arcana-seven-sacraments}

\mysubsection{Divine Favor}{liturgies-divine-favor}

You may call upon your Small God to directly intercede on your behalf.  To do this, you must roll \mybold{all} of your Faith dice, the \SUMDICE of the roll must be 60 or better.

The divine favor must be something your Small God would have some control over, based on their aspect (Arbiter's discretion).  For example, Vulcan (Small God of fires, volcanoes, and the forge, who sits beneath the Civilized Authority) might not be able to affect the curse of the Ice Queen.  

The Small Gods cannot violate the basic laws of the Authority:


\mybullet {
  \item Matter and energy can neither be created nor destroyed, as this is the demesne of \TheAuthority; they can only be transformed or changed from one form to another.  Once a spirit has departed for the Isle of the Dead, it is beyond the reach of the Small Gods forever. 

  \item Entropy always increases.  Time cannot flow backward; sword strikes cannot heal; you cannot "fall" against the direction of gravity. It is possible to suspend this Law (to roll back time, for instance), but only for a few Moments before it reverts to entropy again.

  \item A \myital{noumenon} cannot be removed by a Small God. A Small God cannot directly slay something on the Mortal plane.

  \item All matter and energy has a destiny in the dream of \TheAuthority.  A Small God cannot cause matter or energy to do something that violates this destiny, and the ultimate destiny is only known to \TheAuthority. (Practically, this means the effects of a Divine Favor are up to the Arbiter's discretion in the end!)

}


The Small God may also demand a sacrifice of some kind, or expect payment later ...


\example {
  \mylist {
    \item Time rolls back for a few seconds to stop a killing blow from falling, or to re-roll a missed Save.

    \item A powerful magical item or artifact needs to be sundered

    \item A sea must be parted, a tunnel opened through a mountain, or a boulder pushed to seal an entrance

    \item Stones and trees, or sand and ice, assemble themselves into a fortress to protect the faithful
  }
}




\newpage

\mysubsection{The Authorities}{mystics-authorities}

The Small Gods sit in uncountable multitudes beneath the ten Authorities (though there are said to be 13 in all, 3 hidden from the eyes of Mortals). Your personal Faith in a Small God allows you to invoke the Liturgies of the Authority they sit beneath. Each Authority has four core Liturgies practiced by the faithful: 

\mybullet {
    \item the Liturgy of the Novitiates;
    \item the Liturgy of the Clerics;
    \item the Liturgy of the Apostles; and 
    \item the Liturgy of the Saints
}


During your adventures, you may also find Liturgies of your Small God etched on bronze tablets hidden by fearful priests in stinking swamps, forgotten in reliquaries lying in pawn shops, or written in the slime of snails tripping balls on shrooms.  

\mybold{Heresies}

The more esoteric scholars further divide the Authorities into "left hand" and "right hand", placing them in opposition at the feet of \TheAuthority.  This is the realm of zealots and sectarians: those who swear eternal vengeance on the Authority that sits across from them.

The interior of the pyramid is Hallowed ground, and can safely house yourself and up to 12 other Allies. Spectral footmen flit around a banquet table groaning beneath ample food and drink  (no need for anyone to roll Provisions) - anyone who eats from this table heals full Grit and never get drunk.  Warm and comfortable beds lie behind privacy screens; anyone who chooses to rest regains full Flesh.
