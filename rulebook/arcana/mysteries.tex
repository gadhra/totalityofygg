\MYSTERY [
  Name = Armor of the Gods,
  Link = arcana-mystery-armor-of-the-gods,
  Paradigm = Force,
  Save = N,
  Duration = Session,
  Target = Self
]

You can't wear any other armor while wearing Armor of the Gods.  What the armor looks like is up to you, but it should be elaborate/brutal/gilded etc. - something that makes you stand out in a crowd.  Your \MD drops to d4; the \UD for the Armor depends on the number of \DICE invested: 1 d4; 2 d6; 3 d8; 4 d10; 5+ d12.  The Armor cannot be repaired; once its \UD is exhausted, the Armor disappears.


\MYSTERY [
  Name = Clamp,
  Link = arcana-mystery-clamp,
  Paradigm = Force,
  Save = Y (neg.),
  Duration = varies,
  Target = Nearby Target(s)
]

A clamp of red light appears over \DICE Monsters or objects you designate. The maximum width of the clamp is \DICE meters, and the clamp must be able to fit around the objects (so you wouldn't be able to clamp something to a floor or a wall).  The clamp will push the objects together until they are held securely, but it will not damage either object.  For example, you could clamp an orc to a chair or a sword to a table.  If one of the things clamped is a living thing, the creature can break free if they \RB : \VIG with a -\DICE penalty; otherwise, the duration depends on the number of dice spent:  1 [die]: Minutes; 2 \DICE: Days; 3 \DICE: Weeks; 4 \DICE: Months; 5 \DICE: Years; 6+ \DICE: Permanent.  Save negates.


\MYSTERY [
  Name = Divvy,
  Link = arcana-mystery-divvy,
  Paradigm = Entropy,
  Save = N,
  Duration = Permanent,
  Target = Close Target(s)
]

You can command something that's a mixture of different types (soup, coins, etc.) weighing no more than \DICE X50kg to separate into \DICE+1 categories.  The categories have to be clear and easily identifiable by inspecting them, and they have to be able to flow freely.  For example, you could split a soup into "vegetables" "broth" and "poison", or a pile of coins into "minted during the last century" and "older". You could not, however, split a pile of coins into "handled by Xerphion the Tyrant" and "not handled by Xerphion the Tyrant", as there's no way to tell just by inspecting them. You could not separate "a locked chest" and "its contents", because the items could not flow freely into separate piles.


\MYSTERY [
  Name = Exchequer,
  Link = arcana-mystery-exchequer,
  Paradigm = Entropy,
  Save = N,
  Duration = Instant,
  Target = Close Target(s)
]

You can convert up to \SUMDICE kg of coins into coins of another type of equivalent value (as a reminder, there are 100 coins in a kg, and 4kg of coins are 1 Significant Item). For example, if the \SUMDICE of your dice roll was 10 you could convert 1,000 iron pieces (10kg) into 100 silver pieces (1kg) or 10 gold pieces (1/10kg); or you could convert 10 gold pieces into 100 silver pieces or 1,000 iron pieces. Additionally, you can place up to \DICE X100kg of coins into "Hammerspace" for an indefinite period of time; the coins essentially cease to exist, have no Burden, and cannot be stolen or taken by others (though the existence of the coins can be divined through a Scry spell or similar).  You can retrieve the coins at any time (though you have to retrieve all of them at once).  The coins are also released upon your death, meaning that you might occasionally be a target of thieves.
You can combine the effects above (so you could convert money and store it in Hammerspace if you'd like).  You must cast this spell each time you want to put more coins into Hammerspace, but everything that's in Hammerspace is released upon your death.

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Forgehammer,
  Link = arcana-mystery-forgehammer,
  Paradigm = Force,
  Save = N,
  Duration = Session,
  Target = Self
]

A magical blacksmith's hammer appears in your hand that only you can wield.  The hammer deals \DICE+\DICE damage up to a maximum of 8. You fight with this weapon using your \FOC (instead of your \VIG).  You can repair the Max \UD of an Ally's armor during a Bivouac; for every \DCUP you repair in this way, the damage of the hammer goes down by 2. The Forgehammer can strike creatures who are only struck by magical weapons, but because there is no die to roll when dealing damage, it cannot Crit or be Fumbled.

Once the damage die is exhausted (reaches 0), the Forgehammer disappears.


\MYSTERY [
  Name = Hone,
  Link = arcana-mystery-hone,
  Paradigm = Force,
  Save = N,
  Duration = Combat or \SUM Minutes,
  Target = Close Target(s)
]

You run your hands over \DICE metal, stone, or wooden edges and hone them to a razor sharpness. If the object is a Bashing weapon, it deals +\DICE damage; if the object is a Stabbing or Chopping weapon, it deals +\DICE X2 damage. The edge must be smaller than your outstretched arms.

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Millworks,
  Link = arcana-mystery-millworks,
  Paradigm = Entropy,
  Save = N,
  Duration = Instant,
  Target = Close Target(s)
]

A tree no larger than \DICE X 5m tall and \DICE meters in diameter topples over, as if neatly cut. The result depends on the dice you invest. 1 \DICE: cut and broadly de-limbed, 2 \DICE: cut, de-limbed, debarked, 3 \DICE: cut, de-limbed, debarked, cut into planks as per your specifications, stacked, 4 \DICE cut, planed, de-limbed, debarked, cut into planks, stacked, sanded, and finished. Small limbs and offcuts will be piled for kindling. Alternatively, you can reduce the tree to sawdust or wood chips in 20-\SUMDICE minutes


\MYSTERY [
  Name = Package Neatly,
  Link = arcana-mystery-package-neatly,
  Paradigm = Entropy,
  Save = n/a,
  Duration = Concentration or Permanent,
  Target = Nearby Target(s)
]

Up to \DICE X250kg of nonliving objects, as you designate, are packed neatly. You must name the objects or their general category when you cast the spell ("those coins", "the contents of that room") If no packing materials are provided, the objects will be stacked into compact cubes, with the largest and most stable objects at the bottom. If chests, paper and twine, sacks, carts, etc. are provided, the spell will use them as you direct. The packages created will take up the minimum space possible, and will be remarkably sturdy. The spell will continue to pack objects for as long as you maintain concentration. The objects must be able to move freely. You could not use this spells to pack clothes someone was wearing. The objects will not lift more than 3m off the ground during the packing process.

\mysubsection{Cthonic}{arcana-mystery-cthonic}
\MYSTERY [
  Name = Abyssal Trident,
  Link = arcana-mystery-abyssal-trident,
  Paradigm = Force,
  Save = N,
  Duration = Session,
  Target = Self
]

A magical trident appears in your hand that only you can wield.  The trident is a 2-handed weapon that deals \DICE+\DICE damage up to a maximum of 12.   You fight with this weapon using your \FOC (instead of your \VIG).  Every time the trident deals damage, its damage goes down by 1. The trident can strike creatures who are only struck by magical weapons, but because there is no die to roll when dealing damage, it cannot Crit or be Fumbled. 

Once the damage die is exhausted (reaches 0), the Abyssal Trident disappears.

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Davy Jones's Locker,
  Link = arcana-mystery-davy-joness-locker,
  Paradigm = Prophesy,
  Save = N,
  Duration = Instant,
  Target = Close Target(s)
]

You must be near a body of water to use this liturgy (a river is OK, a puddle isn't).  You summon a chest up to \DICE meters in length, width, and height.  The box can hold up to \DICE X100kg in weight, or about 25 Significant Items (provided the box is big enough in terms of height, width, and depth i.e. you could lie a 2 meter long pole in a 2 [die] locker).  Once you seal the box and carve your name onto it, the waters will take the locker back beneath the surface, where it will disappear.  At any time, you can return to the same body of water and bring the locker back from the depths. Nothing else can bring the locker back from the deeps (not even the liturgy of Dredge) except your death.  When you die, the locker will wash up on shore within a few days for some lucky (or unlucky) soul to find.
If you place a living thing inside, it can breathe - but it will starve or die of thirst without food or water (incidentally, this is a great way to make \myital{vodyanoi})

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Dredge,
  Link = arcana-mystery-dredge,
  Paradigm = Mind,
  Save = N,
  Duration = Concentration,
  Target = Close or Nearby
]

The ground \DICE+\DICE meters in diameter (with you at the center) rumbles and quakes.  Buried or covered objects rise \DICE x5 meters to the surface.  Coins, stones, and roots will be pulled to the surface; if you cast it on water, sunken objects will rise to the surface and remain as long as you concentrate.  The objects cannot weigh more than \DICE x100kg.  

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Excavate,
  Link = arcana-mystery-excavate,
  Paradigm = Elements,
  Save = N,
  Duration = Instant,
  Target = Close
]

You can remove up to \DICE inorganic materials from a \DICE x5 meter cube just in front of your feet.  The materials could be "stone", "water", "dirt", etc. The materials disappear permanently. Objects that would be suspended in the material removed will obey the laws of physics - removing water will cause the surrounding water to rush in, removing dirt from around a chest will cause the chest to fall, etc.

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Fade,
  Link = arcana-mystery-fade,
  Paradigm = Mind,
  Save = Y (neg.),
  Duration = Markovian,
  Target = Nearby Target(s)
]

You can cause a Ally, Monster, or object to fade out of existence.  You can still see them, though they're insubstantial (like a ghost).  The target can't move, talk, or interact with the world in any way.  Not even magic can affect the target.  If the target is unwilling, it gets a Save to negate.  The duration is Markovian and depends on the number of \DICE invested.

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Mermaid's Breath,
  Link = arcana-mystery-mermaids-breath,
  Paradigm = Biomancy,
  Save = Y (neg.),
  Duration = \SUM Minutes,
  Target = Self or Close Target(s)
]

For \SUMDICE Minutes, up to \DICE+1 Allies or Monsters (including yourself) can breathe water as if it were air.  They can only breathe water, however - breathing air will cause them to drown. Unwilling creatures get a Save to negate.  You must touch the Creature to bestow this mystery upon them. 

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Sinister Stillness,
  Link = arcana-mystery-sinister-stillness,
  Paradigm = Mind,
  Save = N,
  Duration = Combat or \SUM Minutes,
  Target = Close\, Nearby\, Far-Away\, or Distant
]

You can invoke this liturgy in an area  Close, Nearby, Far-Away, or Distant from yourself.  The air Close to the area takes on an unsettling air of silence.  Sound is not magically suppressed, but Monsters and creatures within its bounds feel that any sound they make will disturb something better left undisturbed.  Non-intelligent animals will not enter the area, and Monsters inside must make an immediate morale check. Thereafter, Saves against fear effects have a -\DICE and morale rolls suffer a -\DICE penalty (maximum -4).  A morale check is needed to enter or pass through the area of the spell.

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Sound the Deeps,
  Link = arcana-mystery-sound-the-deeps,
  Paradigm = Force,
  Save = N,
  Duration = Instant,
  Target = Close Target(s)
]

You slap your hand on the ground or the surface of the water.  The echoes of the tremor allow you to precisely know how deep and the approximate shape of bodies of water, chasms, shafts, clefts, mountain peaks, caverns, passages, etc.  up to a distance of \DICE x100m meters.  Additionally, you may use this to rouse \DICE+\DICE Allies Close, Nearby, Far Away, or Distant who are Sleeping, Knocked Out, etc.

\mysubsection{Cunning}{arcana-mystery-cunning}
\MYSTERY [
  Name = Expertise,
  Link = arcana-mystery-expertise,
  Paradigm = Mind,
  Save = N,
  Duration = \SUM Minutes,
  Target = Self
]

Name a Skill - it can be one of the 7 basic skills, or any other skill you choose (though you can't learn things that would not be contained in a well stocked library, or that are so rare that only a few people could teach them to you).  You are Skilled (d12+2) in that Skill for the spell's duration.  If you already know the Skill at a level of Skilled or better, add +\DICE x2 (up to a maximum of +4) to your Skill roll.

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Illusion,
  Link = arcana-mystery-illusion,
  Paradigm = Mind,
  Save = N,
  Duration = Varies,
  Target = See Below
]

You create an illusion of anything you desire. If anything touches the illusion, it will pass through it with no effect.  The illusion cannot be greater than \DICE x \DICE meters in size.  Think of the illusion as a perfectly accurate hologram that you are creating - the illusion can be heard in addition to being seen, can perform the same action over and over again, and can deliver messages, but it can't interact in a meaningful way or perform complex actions based on external forces. 

Each aspect of the illusion requires one or more Faith to cast:

\mybullet {
  \item You want the illusion to say up to \DICE + \DICE words or make \DICE + \DICE sounds (wailing, shouting, etc)
  \item You want the illusion to be a physical thing (hole in the ground, stone wall, orc guard, etc)
  \item You want the illusion to be able to move up to \DICE meters
  \item You want to cast the illusion on a living creature (disguise them as a beggar or a lamp post)
}

Note that there is some Arbiter's discretion here.  A guard pacing in front of a door might cost 2 \DICE (a physical thing moving back and forth 2
meters), but if you want the illusion of acrobats or pouncing lions it will be more costly.  A disguise cast on someone to appear to be a beggar might
cost 1 [die] (a living creature wearing the face and clothing of a random beggar), but disguising yourself as the king will be significantly harder.

The Illusion will last for \DICE Hours.  Anyone touching the illusion will immediately know it to be fake, but this doesn't cause the illusion to
disappear.  However, if the illusion is touched with an \mylink{Ego Weapon}{wizardry-ego-weapon}, it will immediately evaporate.

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Labyrinth,
  Link = arcana-mystery-labyrinth,
  Paradigm = Mind,
  Save = N,
  Duration = Combat or \SUM Minutes,
  Target = Self
]

You create a spiraling labyrinth of thought in your mind.  Anyone targeting you with Charm, Sleep, or any magical effect where the caster tries to read your mind or alter your memories must enter into a \RB : \FOC contest with you at a -\DICE penalty.  If they fail, they will be caught in your mind for the duration of the spell;  their physical body immediately catches the Vapors, and you can hear all their thoughts.

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Memory Lane,
  Link = arcana-mystery-memory-lane,
  Paradigm = Mind,
  Save = Y (neg.),
  Duration = Varies,
  Target = Close Target(s)
]

You can create a memory (real or not) and embed it in the head(s) of up to \DICE creatures by touch.  Unwilling creatures may Save to negate the spell.  The memory must be short and distinct.  The memory will start to fade in a few days, but if you win a \RB : \FOC attempt against the victim (the victim has a -\DICE penalty) when you invoke the mystery, the memory will never fade, even if they lose all other memories (incidentally, this is is a really great way to create a ghost or poltergeist).

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Mirror Image,
  Link = arcana-mystery-mirror-image,
  Paradigm = Mind,
  Save = n/a,
  Duration = Minutes,
  Target = Self
]

You create \DICE illusory images of yourself, which move as you move and always stay Close to you. They are constantly stepping through each other, so that it is impossible to tell which is which. When an enemy attacks you, roll to see if they hit you or an image (equal chance). An image vanishes as soon as it suffers a solid impact (a blow from a mace, but also a slap). Area effects such as a dragon's breath will cause all images to instantly vanish (and you'll take fire breath damage, naturally).

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Paralysis,
  Link = arcana-mystery-paralysis,
  Paradigm = Mind,
  Save = Y (neg.),
  Duration = Markovian,
  Target = Close or Nearby Target(s)
]

Up to \DICE creatures of \DICE \HD or less must Save or be Paralyzed.  Sleeping creatures do not get a Save. The duration is Markovian and depends on the number of \DICE invested

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Strange Copy,
  Link = arcana-mystery-strange-copy,
  Paradigm = Mind,
  Save = N,
  Duration = \SUM Hours,
  Target = Close Target(s)
]

You reach into a mirror-like surface and pull out a copy of an object reflected in the mirror. The object that you pull out must be within reach of the mirror (as if it were a window), small enough to fit through the mirror (as if it were a window) and can't weigh more than \DICE x10kg. The mirror object looks and feels exactly like the object it copied, though it is a mirror image (so if you were to copy a book, the text would be backwards).  You can't copy any magical properties of the object, and you can only duplicate objects, not living things.  The object exists for \SUMDICE Hours.  If the object suffers a solid blow, it pops like a bubble.

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Twin,
  Link = arcana-mystery-twin,
  Paradigm = Mind,
  Save = N,
  Duration = \SUM Minutes,
  Target = Close Target(s)
]

You reach into a mirror-like surface and pull out a copy of yourself.  The mirrored surface has to be big enough for you to walk through - same height and same width, at least.  The copy behaves just like you, but it's illusory - anything that touches it will pass right through it, and it can't pick anything up or hold anything.  You can switch places with your mirror-self by stepping through the mirror - this dispels the illusion, and you appear wherever your mirror self is at the moment you step through.

\mysubsection{Empyrean}{arcana-mystery-empyrean}
\MYSTERY [
  Name = Children of Shul,
  Link = arcana-mystery-children-of-shul,
  Paradigm = Prophesy,
  Save = Y (half),
  Duration = Session,
  Target = Self
]

You create \DICE small moons that circle the top of your head, casting moonlight Close and Nearby.  The shadows thrown by this moonlight give a +\DICE bonus (up to +4) to all Whispers made by Allies who are Close to you.  The moonlight will also activate abilities and powers that manifest in lunar rays (like lycanthropy), and throw light equivalent to \DICE x10 candles.

You can unerringly throw one these moons at Nearby Monsters every Moment, striking for 4 damage each (including creatures only struck by Magic weapons).  When you have no moons left, the spell ends.

The moons can be dispelled at any time, but can only be summoned once a Session.

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Glorious Sunburst,
  Link = arcana-mystery-glorious-sunburst,
  Paradigm = Elements,
  Save = Y (half),
  Duration = Combat or \SUM Minutes,
  Target = See Below
]

You raise your hands to the heavens and fire a flare up to 50m upwards, where it hovers providing bright sunlight to all areas Close, Nearby, and Far-Away.  You can command the sunburst to change color, move horizontally, or explode.  No shadows can be cast beneath the sunlight (meaning sneaking around is difficult if not impossible), and all invisible creatures and objects appear with a thin halo around them the color of the sun.  Anyone who performs the sacrament Curse the Unhallowed while under the Glorious Sunburst adds an additional +\DICE x2 to their damage; anyone Close to the sunburst if it explodes takes \SUMDICE+\DICE damage, Save for half.

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Lightning,
  Link = arcana-mystery-lightning,
  Paradigm = Elements,
  Save = Y (half),
  Duration = Instant,
  Target = Close or Nearby Target(s)
]

Forks of lightning erupt from your forehead, striking a Close or Nearby target for \SUMDICE+\DICE damage (Save for half). You can cause the lightning to "jump" up to \DICE-1 times to another creature or object Close by, provided they are conductive (iron armor, metal ladders, etc).  Magic swords aren't conductive.  You can "ping-pong" between two objects if you desire. Creatures struck by a secondary (or greater) lightning bolt take \DICE damage (no Save). Objects struck by the lightning bolt will become momentarily electrified, and deal a shock that could cause someone to lose their grip unless they \RO : \VIG + \FOC with a -\DICE penalty.

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Lunacy,
  Link = arcana-mystery-lunacy,
  Paradigm = Mind,
  Save = Y (neg.),
  Duration = Markovian,
  Target = Close or Nearby Target(s)
]

You invoke the madness of the moon.  \DICE creatures must immediately \RS : Sanity; if they do not have Sanity (Monsters, for instance) the creatures are permitted a Save.

The Lunacy is random for each Monster that fails its Save.  Roll a d4:  1) the Monster becomes Enraged at someone or something that isn't an Ally; 2) the Monster becomes Afraid of you and your Allies; 3) the Monster is Knocked Out; 4) the Monster suffers Anathema.  The duration is Markovian and depends on the number of \DICE used.

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Mountainhands,
  Link = arcana-mystery-mountainhands,
  Paradigm = Biomancy,
  Save = N,
  Duration = Session,
  Target = Self
]

Your hands enlarge and become stone.  Unarmed Attacks do +\DICE damage (up to a maximum of +4).  In addition, you can reach your hands into substances that might affect Flesh but not stone (fire, boiling water - OK.  Lava or acid - not OK).  Holding a stone in your hands allows you to speak to it as the Murk ability (see the Core Rules). 

Your hands must be empty (including rings and gloves) in order to invoke this mystery. You can only invoke this mystery once per Session.

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Rainburst,
  Link = arcana-mystery-rainburst,
  Paradigm = Elements,
  Save = n/a,
  Duration = Combat or \SUM Minutes,
  Target = See Below
]

You create a rainstorm in the surrounding area.  The rain extinguishes all fires (even magical ones) for the duration, prevents non-magical fires from starting, and heals Allies and Monsters alike for \SUMDICE Flesh (once at the moment of invocation).  The range is dependent on the number of \DICE invested: 1 Close; 2-3 Close and Nearby; 4-6 Close, Nearby, and Far-Away; 7+ Close, Nearby, Far-Away, and Distant.

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Resonating Command,
  Link = arcana-mystery-resonating-command,
  Paradigm = Mind,
  Save = Y (neg.),
  Duration = Markovian,
  Target = Nearby Target(s)
]

You shout a one word command at up to \DICE Close or Nearby target, who must obey (Save negates).  The target(s) must be able to understand your language.  The command resonates for a Markovian duration - if the Markovian die is not a 1 or a 2, they must Save again.  Each Moment after the first the target(s) gain an additional +1 to their Save.  The command cannot directly cause the target(s) harm or force them to commit a harmful action.  You could cause them to run into a trap they didn't know was there, or into a tactically disadvantageous position, but not off a cliff.

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Thunderclap,
  Link = arcana-mystery-thunderclap,
  Paradigm = Elements,
  Save = Y (neg.),
  Duration = Instant,
  Target = Far-Away or Distant

You can invoke this mystery somewhere Far-Away or Distant from yourself.  Monsters Close to the Thunderclap must immediately make a morale check with a -\DICE penalty, or become Afraid of you.  Additionally, Monsters become Deafened for \DICE Moments unless they make a Save with a -\DICE penalty.

  Save = n/a,
  Duration = Session,
  Target = Self
]

Take \DICE Faith and put them "in reserve".  For the remainder of the Session, you may sacrifice one of these [die] to cause any single \mybold{physical} attack that would damage you to miss instead of hit.  You must sacrifice the [die] \myital{before} you roll your Guard or Save.  You can only use 1 [die] per Moment.  Any unused \DICE are lost at the end of the Session.  You can only invoke this mystery once per Session.

\MYSTERY [
  Name = Capture Wind,
  Link = arcana-mystery-capture-wind,
  Paradigm = Elements,
  Save = N,
  Duration = Concentration or Session,
  Target = See Below
]

A magical circle \DICE meters in radius extends from your fingertip in front of you. As long as you maintain concentration, you can absorb any wind passing through the circle. You can then collapse the spell. 

At any time during the Session, you can reactivate the circle to release the wind you absorbed.  The wind flows out at the same rate it entered. If you activate this spell in a light breeze for 5 minutes, the spell will release a light breeze over 5 minutes. The wind only flows from the circle, so anyone standing behind it is not affected (unless you release hurricane-force winds indoors). You can cancel the release at any time, which expends the spell as usual. If you go to 0 Flesh while the spell is still "reserved", it immediately activates facing a random direction.  

If the wind is a magical breath that would do damage (dragon's breath, etc.) your \SUMDICE must be equal to or greater than the sum of the damage, or the circle immediately collapses.  

\MYSTERY [

A magical rapier appears in your hand that only you can wield.  The rapier deals \DICE+\DICE damage up to a maximum of 6.  You must make a successful Fight check using your \FOC (instead of \VIG or \DEX).  The Hero's Rapier ignores Armor and Soak, and while you wield it you always win Init. The rapier can strike creatures who are only struck by magical weapons, but because there is no die to roll when dealing damage, it cannot Crit or be Fumbled.
