  \myhighlight{Hale}{knave-flesh}

  Knaves start with d8 \FLESH 

  \myhighlight{Puissance}{knave-puissance}

  Knaves add their \LVL to any \RO or \RB attempt they're trying that includes their \DEX.  

  \myhighlight{Luck Dice}{knave-luck-die}

  Knaves have a Luck Die (d4 to start) - a unique \UD whose result can be applied to any \RO or \RB try that includes \DEX.  Roll the Luck Die and add its result to your \RO or \RB check.  You can only roll your Luck Die once per \RO or \RB

  \myhighlight{Whispers}{knave-whispers}

  Through sleight of hand, mind manipulation, minor illusion, complex gestures, and arcane words, Knaves are able to perform "superhuman" feats of thievery (climbing unclimbable walls, disguising themselves, passing through shadows, etc.)  These Arcana are collectively known as \mybold{Whispers}.  There are 4 Whispers in total (the Whispers of Anne Bonnny, the Whispers of Br'er Rabbit, the Whispers of Sun Wukong, and the Whispers of the Bride) - each a different Virtue - that a Knave can learn.

    \myhighlight{Arch-Nemesis}{knave-complication-archnemesis}
    
    You have an arch-nemesis who always seems to be a step ahead of you when it comes to obtaining artifacts. Tell the Arbiter a little bit about them.

    \myhighlight{Cursed}{knave-complication-cursed}

    Probably should have left that amulet alone.  Roll on the {Lesser Curses}{table-lesser-curses} table - you start the game under that curse.  Tell the Arbiter how you acquired this curse.

    \myhighlight{Expensive Tastes}{knave-complication-tastes}

    You have exquisite and deviant tastes for the finer things in life. It costs you twice as much to take a \mylink{Vacation}{civilization-vacation}; the money spent is still applied to your experience.

    \myhighlight{Honor Among Thieves}{knave-complication-honor}

    You're a professional, and you appreciate other professionals.  You'll always give a hand to a fellow Knave even if that might inconvenience you or your \mylink{Band}{the-band}.

    \myhighlight{Outstanding Contract}{knave-complication-contract}

    There's an outstanding contract on your head, revenge for something you did.  Tell the Arbiter who is after you and why they want to kill you.

    \myhighlight{Pacifist}{knave-complication-pacifist}

    You won't ever start a fight (including stabbing someone unawares in the back).  You have no problems fighting once a fight is joined, however.  


    \myhighlight{Pandemonium}{knave-complication-pandemonium}

    You spend money as fast as you can make it, steal from the rich to give to the poor, and thrive in chaos.  You aren't motivated by anything material; you want anarchy, discord, and confusion.    

    \myhighlight{Religious}{knave-complication-religious}

    You are very religious (secretly or not).  You don't worship a specific Small God necessarily, but you have enormous respect for Mystics, \TheAuthority, and the Authorities.  You won't steal anything from a church or temple; priest of priestess - regardless of the Small God.


    \myhighlight{Remorseless}{knave-complication-remorseless}

    You feel nothing when you take a life or cause pain, but you suffer from \mylink{Night Terrors}{madness-night-terrors}.  This affliction can never be cured.


    \myhighlight{Superstitious}{knave-complication-superstitious}

    You are extremely superstitious (and believe this superstition has kept you alive up until now).  You fear the Jinx and prefer the company of Pooka whenever possible.  You won't steal from the dead, or take anything from tombs or graves.
